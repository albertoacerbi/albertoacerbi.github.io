      <title>A few thoughts on cultural attraction</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_cultural_attraction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I am finishing the work on the submission of a modelling paper about cultural attraction theory (the preprint, quite different from the current version, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/vjcq3/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I thought I could go back after a while to a darling of this blog. Writing down these few musings is mostly useful for me, but perhaps they can be interesting for the people that already know the diatribe - the post is hardly a crowd-pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, my general position is more or less stable on what I write five (!) years ago together with Alex Mesoudi (&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-015-9490-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, even if I have a different opinion on many specific points) and, more recently, in the first half of the &amp;ldquo;Transmitting and sharing&amp;rdquo; chapter of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. The points carried forward by cultural attraction theory are valuable and overlooked in much cultural evolution research, so it is important to pay attention to them. Convergent transformation can, as much as faithful copying, bring about cultural stability. Explaining the diffusion of a trait with &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; - a tendency to copy others faithfully - is to assume what requires itself an explanation. We copy the majority, the successful, the elders: until we do not. Individual and social learning are not two different processes, and, yes, I now think that culture &amp;ldquo;is a property, not a thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, hi-fi copying is important in some domains, and there is a limit to what convergent transformations can achieve. Cultural transmission does allow for the diffusion of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; information that can not be reconstructed. Cultural attraction people are correct, technically, when they say that high-fidelity transmission is a special case of attraction, with reconstruction equal to zero, or something analogous. However, I believe that the advantages linked to the generality of a theory depend on what we are trying to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My position is a bit annoying as I guess I end up to slightly irritating both camps, but, despite what you heard on Twitter, academics are a bunch of nice people, and I tend to be able to work with both the factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I became more and more convinced that the main reason for the disagreement resides in the fact that different people ask different &amp;ldquo;deep&amp;rdquo; questions about culture. Thom Scott-Phillips says something similar &lt;a href=&#34;https://thomscottphillips.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/scott-phillips-2016-review-of-lewens.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (at the end of section 2). Many cultural evolutionists are interested to explain what is so special in humans, and the answer is, correctly: culture, as they define it. Many cultural attractionists (?), instead, are interested to explain why some cultural traits are succesfull, given the state of the world and of its inhabitants. Again, I tend to share the latter interest but, of course, both questions are legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar way to put it is that many cultural attractionists are humanists (as in researchers working in the humanities) or social scientists that become frustrated with non-scientific explanations of culture, and pushed interdisciplinarity towards hard sciences. Many cultural evolutionists are instead natural scientists that &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; that culture is important to explain human and, up to a point, non-human behaviour, and pushed  interdisciplinarity the other way around. This does not need to be literally true - people actually following the exact career path - but it seems to me it catches an interesting difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most controversial, cultural attraction theory stresses (recently with more emphasis) that factors of attraction are multifaceted and, in particular, not only cognitive. Again, for the internal consistency of the theory, this is perfectly right. Personally, I met cultural attraction theory (which was called, at the time, &amp;ldquo;epidemiology of representations&amp;rdquo;) reading Dan Sperber&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Explaining-Culture-Naturalistic-Dan-Sperber/dp/0631200452&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Explaining Culture&lt;/a&gt;, and this changed my scientific life (and, as a consequence, if I look at it from today&amp;rsquo;s perspective, my life tout-court). While the book is the classic source for the &amp;ldquo;factors of attraction can be psychological and ecological&amp;rdquo; motto, it is also home of chapters on culture and mental (massive) modularity, anthropology and psychology, etc. For me, at least, there was a clear message that pan-human cognitive similarities constrain the forms that cultures can take, and contribute to explaining them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independently on how these cognitive similarities are implemented and on how they arise, I still believe that cultural attraction theory is more &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; if this message is true, and I would not shy away from that. For reconstruction and convergent transformation to provide satisfying explanations, they should be reconducted to something else, whatever this will be. Of course, the importance of these constraints is variable and domain-dependent, so that in some cases we should prefer reconstruction-based explanations, and in others preservative-transmission-based explanations, but that is, I believe, a stimulating empirical problem for cultural evolutionists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sichuan food and the transience of traditions</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_sichuan/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_sichuan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my secret passion (or not-so-secret, if you know me a bit) is cooking. Last weekend was devoted to the new edition of Fuchsia Dunlop&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Sichuan-Fuchsia-Dunlop/dp/1324004835&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Food of Sichuan&lt;/a&gt;, widely considered as one of the best western-accessible resource on the topic. If you want to know, I cooked &amp;lsquo;Strange Flavour&amp;rsquo; Bang Bang Chicken and Fish-Fragrant Aubergines. (Both will need much improvement&amp;mdash;for example I ended up burning the peanuts while deep-frying them&amp;hellip;&amp;mdash; so if I ever happen to offer to cook you Sichuan food, ask for my only piece of resistance so far, the classic Mapo Tofu.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has a fairly good historical introduction, where a few things caught my eye. Sure, the cuisine of Sichuan is renowned for its variety, and for the ability to combine several ingredients to create distinctive flavour combinations, but at the end of the day many of us will appreciate it for the signature &amp;ldquo;hot-and-numbing&amp;rdquo; taste given by the combination of Sichuan pepper (in the picture below) and abundant serving of chillies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, at odd with my intuitive idea of a millennia-old culinary tradition, chillies obviously &amp;ldquo;only reached China in the late sixteenth century [&amp;hellip;] probably brought to China by Portuguese traders&amp;rdquo;. The &lt;em&gt;barbarian peppers&lt;/em&gt; were considered an ornamental plant: &amp;ldquo;it would be at least another century before the use of chillies to flavour food was documented&amp;rdquo;. According to this account, &amp;ldquo;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796-1820)&amp;rdquo; that the plant was established as a local crop in Sichuan, that is, two centuries ago. Deep-frying, which I associated intimately with Chinese cuisine, seems even more recent in Sichuan: &amp;ldquo;an interest in deep-frying [&amp;hellip;] is said to have come from Americans in 1930s Chongqing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of my previous research about Swedish food. (Yes, when living in Stockholm I had a blog about Swedish food, alas only in Italian, but you can have a look at some popular post, for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucinasvedeseperitaliani.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/surstromming/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucinasvedeseperitaliani.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/kottbullar/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Many classic recipes of the Swedish traditions were, in fact, the results of a few successful recipe books that appeared after the Second World War and canonised the &lt;em&gt;Husmanskost&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; home-cooked Swedish food. Traditional is in quotation marks not by chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is an Italian classic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonara&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pasta alla carbonara&lt;/a&gt;. Some even speculate that it was invented to please American soldiers during the liberation of Rome in 1944, by reminding them of their eggs and bacon breakfasts. Whatever this is true or not (it looks too good to be true though), the recipe is never mentioned before the Second World War, suggesting a recent origin. By the way: no onions and no cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe many other examples can be found for &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; dishes. This is of course nothing new. Another of my not-so-secrets is that I had a classic anthropological formation, and, in socio-cultural anthropology, the idea that traditions are often &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Invention_of_Tradition.html?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;invented&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Imagined_Communities.html?id=nQ9jXXJV-vgC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;imagined&lt;/a&gt; is common currency. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kSukCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=how+traditions+live+and+day&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRkqKZu9DlAhWtTxUIHY53AtkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=how%20traditions%20live%20and%20day&amp;amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;How Traditions Live and Die&lt;/a&gt; Olivier Morin makes an analogous point using the example of Highland&amp;rsquo;s clans tartans, that were single-handedly created by a fabric producer in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other traditions may be indeed millennia old. For example, Sara Graça da Silva and Jamie Tehrani used &lt;a href=&#34;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150645&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;phylogenetic methods&lt;/a&gt; to analyse the relationships between folktales in Indo-European-speaking societies, and they claim to have found &amp;ldquo;evidence that one tale (‘The Smith and the Devil’) can be traced back to the Bronze Age&amp;rdquo;. The point is: we should be wary of considering traditions as, by-default, ancient and robust (perhaps because of an inborn tendency to copy others). Some may be, and others may be not. I wonder whether cultural evolutionists, beside Morin&amp;rsquo;s book and a less recent, and not very well-known I believe, book from Pascal Boyer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Tradition_as_Truth_and_Communication.html?id=Wuf2PXR1pBgC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tradition as Truth and Communication&lt;/a&gt;), have explored in detail the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more general reflection: a backbone of cultural evolution is population thinking, which implies that culture is an emergent, population-level, product of individual interactions, and individual interactions are where the causal magic happens (at least, this is how I read it). From this perspective, it looks natural to think to cultural traditions in a non-essentialist way: they are just the temporary result of individual interactions, looked at on a certain zoom level. However, sometimes &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; is essentialised and used itself as an explanation, as in &amp;ldquo;we do it &lt;em&gt;because of our culture&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. These kinds of explanations are more and more present when reporting and justifying transcultural experiments (a good criticism of this notion of culture is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/18/3-4/article-p231_1.xml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; from Lawrence Hirschfeld). Transcultural experiments are important and necessary, but we need to be cautious when we say that &amp;ldquo;eastern people&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the Aka&amp;rdquo;, or any other experimental group, behave differently because of &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo;. It could be, but it could also be that many, interrelated, possibly short-lived, traditions create a specific situation, and it would be interesting to be able to disentangle these possibilities. Anthropologists (in anthropology the WEIRD problem is as a minumum a century-old one: a true tradition!) have recognised this problem, but the solutions proposed have not been, in my opinion, particularly successful, but this may be material for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Vaccine hesitancy is not correlated with social media penetration at country-level in Europe</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_wellcome/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_wellcome/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wellcome Trust has recently (yesterday) released the 2018 &lt;a href=&#34;https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Global Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a 140,000 people survey on how ‘people around the world think and feel about science and major health challenges’. Among the many interesting pieces of information, not surprisingly, attitudes towards vaccinations are starting to be widely discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/survey-shows-crisis-of-confidence-in-vaccines-in-parts-of-europe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first important thing to notice, as the Wellcome Trust correctly does, is that ‘worldwide, 79% of people agree that vaccines are safe and 84% agree that they are effective’ and ‘92% of parents worldwide said that their children have received a vaccine to prevent them from getting childhood diseases .’ Whatever we may think, the majority of people around the world rightly believe that vaccines are good. Of course, there is a minority of people, especially in western countries, that is less convinced of that. Citing again the Wellcome Trust, ‘In France, one in three people disagree that vaccines are safe, the highest percentage for any country worldwide’. The France figure is, however, one of few outliers, also for western countries, where the averages of people disagreeing that vaccines are safe are around 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, that one out of ten persons in western countries could think as such is worrying. Not surprisingly, social media has been identified as one of the culprits of this situation, and I bet that, following the Wellcome Trust survey, the trend will continue (I already found one article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/anti-vaxx-vaccination-myth-poll-europe-pro-nature-birth-a8964441.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Out of curiosity, I correlated the Wellcome trust data with recent data on social media penetration/usage in Europe, and they are not correlated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./social_media.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was on it, I also correlated the data with the importance of religion..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./religion.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;the trust in science&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./science.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and the GDP pro capita&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./gdp.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this is a very basic analysis. It could be for example that, within countries, people that are sceptical of vaccines use more social media than others. That anti-vaxx information spreads effectively in social media is not surprising. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(15)00197-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661315001977%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;many reasons&lt;/a&gt; why anti-vaccination beliefs are easy to spread (and, conversely, it could be more difficult with pro-vaccination beliefs). Information around vaccines is psychologically attractive, involving potentially disgust and counterintuitive concepts that, coupled with a possible negative bias, make fearmongering on vaccines a good topic for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. All of this, however, is not a prerogative of digital social media (where correct, pro-vaccine, information &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2670250&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;also spreads effectively&lt;/a&gt;), and vaccine hesitancy is &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethmnookin.com/the-panic-virus/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;as old as vaccines themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, each time you hear someone saying, or writing, that anti-vaccination beliefs are linked to social media you should be sceptical. At least: it is not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, all the technical stuff (data, R script, what I coded exactly as “vaccine hesitancy”, “social media penetration”, etc.) are in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/vaccines-wellcome&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is cultural evolution “neoliberal”?</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_neoliberal/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_neoliberal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been involved, over the weekend, in a small twitter debate on the old question of whether anthropology should use qualitative or quantitative methodologies. The debate was not particularly interesting by itself (I had many, probably too many, similar conversations starting when I was an undergraduate student) and the readers of this blog know, or suspect, my position, so I am not dwelling on it. There is, however, a marginal aspect that made me think a bit: I have the feeling that, when it is all said and done, the negative attitudes toward quantifications are linked to the idea that quantifying human culture is politically “neoliberal”, if not altogether “right-wing”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure that no critic of quantification in anthropology will accept this as their own position and they will express more cogent (at least from their point of view) arguments. It does not matter: I am happy to explore a straw man here. (A tweet that was stating it explicitly appeared at some point over the weekend, and it was “liked” by one of the persons involved in the debate, but that is just a side-note, a “like” on Twitter does not need to mean anything.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas I can grasp why some evolutionary approaches can be considered as supporting neoliberal social policies – even though I think the question is more nuanced and complicated – how can quantification by itself be? Is studying &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0106565&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how movies influence the popularity of dog breeds&lt;/a&gt; neoliberal? Is it &lt;em&gt;counting&lt;/em&gt; how many different &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(16)30274-4/fulltext&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;folktales&lt;/a&gt; there are in different populations? Is cultural evolution, intended as a general project of applying scientific and quantitative methods to the study of culture, neoliberal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enough with rhetorical questions, but I would be interested if anybody knows any scholarly reference or developed argument that support this position (again, I know, it is a straw man). The only reason I can think of is that, in the last decades, researchers working on quantitative approaches to culture have been less active in political matters than researchers working on qualitative approaches, even though my impression is that the formers are politically leaning left as much as the rest of social scientists (at least the people that refer to the “cultural evolution” label).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really not interested in starting a debate, but perhaps there are reasons for considering quantification as such, and I’d be happy to exploit collective intelligence to know more (as said, possibly in the form of scholarly publications, etc.). Ok, I am going back to my R codes now.
