      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake news spreading on social media is often considered the cause of all bad things happened in the last years. From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/michael-gove-boris-johnson-brexit-eurosceptic-press-theresa-may-a7533806.html&#34;&gt;Brexit&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/04/03/a-new-study-suggests-fake-news-might-have-won-donald-trump-the-2016-election/&#34;&gt;election of Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and later to &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247642&#34;&gt;covid anti-vaxx sentiments&lt;/a&gt;, examples are not lacking. Of course, &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; depends on your point of view, but also vaccines and lockdown &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; have been considered a product of &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/episode/3SCsueX2bZdbEzRtKOCEyT&#34;&gt;mass formation psychosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.wordpress.com/2016/08/16/did-technology-disrupt-the-truth-probably-not/&#34;&gt;long-time sceptical&lt;/a&gt; of this line of reasoning. From a &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/how-traditions-live-and-die-9780190210502?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;cognitive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178707/not-born-yesterday&#34;&gt;evolutionary&lt;/a&gt; perspective on &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;cultural transmission&lt;/a&gt;, it makes sense to think to humans not as overly gullible individuals, but as wary social learners, that use relatively sophisticated strategies to decide whether to accept social information or not. In fact, recent empirical studies &lt;a href=&#34;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0052&#34;&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that apparently we do not use social information enough, even when it would be advantageous. You can replace to the stereotype of gullible individuals the one of stubborn agents: the problem seems to be not that we are too easy to influence, but that we do not change our mind when we should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be, naturally, that the situation brought about with the diffusion of social media is so different from offline dynamics that we just cannot cope. This is a legitimate question. However, the broad picture painted by recent research seems to be consistent: fake news rarely changes our minds. We interact with online misinformation because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y&#34;&gt;is fun or engrossing&lt;/a&gt;, to keep &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0452-1&#34;&gt;in contact with others&lt;/a&gt;, to actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21670811.2017.1360143&#34;&gt;debunk it&lt;/a&gt;, or because we are already on the same page, and we want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/partisan-polarization-is-the-primary-psychological-motivation-behind-political-fake-news-sharing-on-twitter/3F7D2098CD87AE5501F7AD4A7FA83602&#34;&gt;signal our political or group membership&lt;/a&gt;. But there is more: when considered together with all the information present on social media, the proportion of fake or deceptive news is often negligible. Depending on the criteria used, the proportion of unreliable news online is generally estimated in single digit percentages, with at worst being around 5% of the total proportion of information (see table 1 &lt;a href=&#34;https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-fighting-misinformation-or-fighting-for-information/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for various estimates).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from this finding, together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/people/sacha-altay&#34;&gt;Sacha Altay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/&#34;&gt;Hugo Mercier&lt;/a&gt;, we recently published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-fighting-misinformation-or-fighting-for-information/&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; that considers how much effort is worth allocating to fight online misinformation. Assume that people believe only some of the reliable news they encounter and only some of the unreliable news. Given the relative paucity of online misinformation, efforts to increase belief in reliable information will have a bigger effect than contrary efforts to decrease belief in unreliable information. To test this intuition (Hugo&amp;rsquo;s intuition&amp;hellip;), we developed a simple model. The figure below illustrates the main result. We started by devising a measure of the total amount of &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; in the system (&amp;ldquo;Global information score&amp;rdquo;, on the y-axis in the figure). Think about the &amp;ldquo;Global information score&amp;rdquo; as an index that is maximum (100) when all and only reliable information is trusted, and minimum when only and all unreliable information is (-100). Given a 5% of proportion of unreliable information, if we completely wipe out belief in unreliable information, the Global information score increases of one or two points (in the figure, the difference between the &amp;ldquo;Baseline&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Intervention on misinformation&amp;rdquo; line). If, instead, we leave the belief in misinformation as it is, and we increase of single percentage points the belief in reliable information, we have a bigger effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./figure_1.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This outcome is robust to various realistic estimates of the relative proportion of reliable/unreliable information, to various baseline tendencies to believe reliable/unreliable information, and, as we explore in the model, works when the exposure to news is unequally distributed as in reality (with very few people consuming a lot of pieces of news, and the majority a few), when acceptance of misinformation decreases trust in reliable information, and when acceptance of misinformation increases the supply of misinformation (see again the &lt;a href=&#34;https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/research-note-fighting-misinformation-or-fighting-for-information/&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; for details). Of course, the model is bare-bones, but I hope it can be extended to include more realistic characteristics (for example, various typologies of news effects, going beyond reliable versus unreliable news) and to support real policy efforts - which is, well, why we made it in first place&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, yes, the title of this post is provocative, but it makes an important point. As we write in the paper, it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that the relative low proportion of fake news that we observe is indeed due to the efforts that are made to control it. But I do think that the academic and societal attention to &amp;ldquo;fake news&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;infodemic&amp;rdquo;, and the like, is disproportionate. Focusing on reliable news on social media, on their engagement potential, on counteracting the decrease of trust in reliable sources, could be more important that fighting a dubious enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that our opponents are motivated by false beliefs (of course, it is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563217306726&#34;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; that fall for fake news!), beside being probably wrong, is also a way to refuse to understand their motivations and, finally, to preclude confrontation. Maybe understanding their reasons could produce better outcomes. Second, fake news offers a convenient and easy-to-conceptualise explanation for problems that are, probably, complex and rooted in deep socio-economical causes. It looks quite comforting to think that, if we can control better Facebook or Twitter, people would start to think as we do, but if that is not the case, the problems may remain unsolved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unsurprising regularity, new &amp;ldquo;scandals&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;shocking&amp;rdquo; information about social media appear in the press, and, of course, in social media themselves. Lately, Facebook seems to be the main target. (Incidentally, why Facebook? My hunch is that academics and journalists, which are the main producers and consumers of this information, tend to not be Facebook users, so it feels less dissonant to think it is the real baddy. If only &lt;em&gt;the others&lt;/em&gt; would understand it! &amp;hellip;Anyway, this is not very important for the rest of the post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, around one month ago, the Washington Post &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1433749542474747910&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;Misinformation on Facebook got six times more clicks than factual news during the 2020 election&amp;rdquo;. The news was, of course, a hit. However, the &amp;ldquo;six times&amp;rdquo; figure seems at odds with much recent literature that shows that, when considered together with the total information present, the amount of misinformation circulating in social media &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau2706&#34;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay3539&#34;&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aau4586&#34;&gt;modest&lt;/a&gt;, something like the 5% of the total information (often less). For this reason, it would have been interesting to know how the &amp;ldquo;clicks&amp;rdquo; were actually calculated or what was exactly considered as &amp;ldquo;misinformation&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately the study to which the Washington Post referred to was not out at the moment, and it is still, after one month, not available (not even in form of preprint, which is now relatively standard practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on &amp;mdash; mid September &amp;mdash; another scandal hit Facebook. This time, it was leaked documents to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739&#34;&gt;the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, titled &amp;ldquo;Facebook Knows Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls, Company Documents Show&amp;rdquo;. You probably heard about it, and about the outraged editorials and comments all around social media: you have here a bad social media company (i) hiding information, and (ii) harming (iii) young girls. Hardly you can have something more attractive. However, it looks like the report was mostly based on a small survey on a few dozens of teenagers that were asked if they &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; Instagram was bad for them, and on &amp;ldquo;focus groups&amp;rdquo; with even less participants, where the reason why they thought it was bad were discussed in more details. Now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(20)30251-5&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10226.short&#34;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562%20018%200506%201?mod=article_inline&#34;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; to have an in-depth knowledge of the effects of Instagram and social media on well-being and mental health, but this survey does not add much to our previous knowledge, so it is difficult to justify the reactions. (A good analysis of the vicissitude can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://unherd.com/2021/09/facebooks-bad-science/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move on to today, and we have the whistleblower Frances Haugen, ex Facebook employee, testifying in front of the US congress. Things get heated, outrage continues, with public personalities pushing on Twitter the sober hashtag &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SachaBaronCohen/status/1445541488889241608&#34;&gt;#FacebookKills&lt;/a&gt;. I admit I did not read the full transcriptions (I am already using precious time by writing this blog post instead of working or, even better, having a walk, as Bristol is sunny in October!), and I am referring to reports from newspapers, in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/facebook-harms-children-damaging-democracy-claims-whistleblower&#34;&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. From what I understand, there are not really big novelties in what the whistleblower reports. She is mostly repeating the accusations that Facebook knew about harming children and teenagers (but see the point above), adding various dubious twists. One is the analogy between social media usage and addiction (I cite: &amp;ldquo;It’s just like cigarettes&amp;hellip;teenagers don&amp;rsquo;t have good self-regulation.&amp;quot;), which is considered &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/blog/social-media-is-nothing-like-drugs-despite-all-the-horror-stories/&#34;&gt;flawed&lt;/a&gt; by practically all researchers in the field. Another is the idea, never &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/32/e2101967118&#34;&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-021-09734-6&#34;&gt;established&lt;/a&gt;, that the algorithm is pushing towards more extreme content (the algorithm &amp;ldquo;led children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes&amp;hellip;all the way to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time&amp;rdquo;). We have gory details (&amp;ldquo;women would be walking around with brittle bones in 60 years’ time because of the anorexia-related content they found on Facebook platforms&amp;rdquo; in the words of the Guardian), and not very surprising considerations, such as that Facebook &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/03/former-facebook-employee-frances-haugen-identifies-herself-as-whistleblower&#34;&gt;put profits before people&lt;/a&gt; (huge if true for a private company). In sum, nothing really new and, mostly, from what I get, nothing that can be actually used to understand better what is going on, a part the usual accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am not in the &amp;ldquo;everything is good as it is&amp;rdquo; team (I do not think anybody is), and there are several things that Facebook and other social media should do to makes things better. A short and idiosyncratic list could include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making their data available and easy to access to researchers and to the general public. Twitter seems slightly better than Facebook about that. (Adding to what said above, Facebook got caught recently in other &amp;ldquo;scandals&amp;rdquo; about errors in sharing data and blocking access to scientists.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No social media, that I am aware, is open about the algorithm they use to present information to users. How our Facebook news feed is decided? What about Twitter? I find the lack of transparency particularly worrying, also because this information would finally allow to give better answers to central questions on the kind of information promoted by social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we make social media better? We could and we certainly should experiment with alternatives. If it is true (see the point above) that, say, social media algorithms push contents that receive more interactions (I called it &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;optimisation for shallow engagement&lt;/a&gt;) and, say &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs42761-021-00046-w&#34;&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt; or strongly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/28/7313.long&#34;&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; content receive more interactions, this could created a vicious circle where negative (say) information receive more interactions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are proposed more, so end up to dominate social media content. But, of course, things are complicated. Many other factors could be relevant (again, we would need to know more about the algorithm!) and, importantly, preferences for negative (say) information could be linked to more general cognitive preferences and be &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/br56y/&#34;&gt;succesfull&lt;/a&gt; independently from social media, so that one would need to balance algorithmic and psychological forces. This is just an example, but many others could be discussed along similar lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes clearly beyond my expertise, but putting Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook (and what else?) in the same hands may not be a good idea. I leave this to people that know more, but it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; that a decentralised system would work better for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on and on. All these are, I think, very reasonable criticisms to Facebook and other social media, and I&amp;rsquo;d be (and am) very supportive of calls to action in this direction. Now, it could be that the periodic outrages are useful, but, call me crazy, I am not sure about that. If one claims that #FacebookKills, it is very easy for Facebook to show that it does not and, well, they are right. The risk is that by muddling sensible requests with sensationalist claims, we are doing Facebook&amp;rsquo;s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps: I may be too old, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jFqhjaGh30&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; the title reference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrewbuskell.com&#34;&gt;Andrew Buskell&lt;/a&gt; just published in &lt;em&gt;Acta Biotheoretica&lt;/em&gt; an insightful combined &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10441-020-09384-x&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/&#34;&gt;Hugo Mercier&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/not-born-yesterday&#34;&gt;Not Born Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. There are many things to appreciate in the review. First - but I may be biased here&amp;hellip; - it is a positive one. Andrew concludes by writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mercier and Acerbi&amp;rsquo;s volumes are enjoyable, story-driven journeys. They guide the reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way. They are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to the recent spate of epistemological doomsayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not have said it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is pleasing to be in good company. &lt;em&gt;Not born yesterday&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent book. In fact, while writing, my own views about how social information is evaluated have somehow glided from a more standard cultural evolution framework to the epistemic (or &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo;) vigilance perspective presented in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s volume. If I would start working on &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; today it would probably be a quite different book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and last, the &amp;ldquo;concerns&amp;rdquo; are also perceptive. One of those is that &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; did not discuss enough the importance of the integration between the literature on social network models and the largely individual-level perspective endorsed in the book. I completely agree. The main theoretical perspectives I drew upon are indeed not particularly sensitive to the topic. Evolutionary psychology theories are mostly theories about individual minds, and while social interactions and communications are certainly important for these theories, they are important with respect to how they shaped those individual minds. (Incidentally, I always thought the evolutionary psychology is one of the approaches that would have more to gain by adopting a modelling perspective, but only very few evolutionary psychology works use it.) Cultural evolution seems more receptive: virtually all theories in cultural evolution take into account population-level dynamics, still populations are generally considered as uniform or - I think - fully-connected networks, i.e. networks were all individuals have the same probability to interact with any other individual in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are exceptions. At least a &lt;a href=&#34;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw0609&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13109&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; adopt an explicit &amp;ldquo;cultural evolution on networks&amp;rdquo; perspective and there is an enormous grey area (the &amp;ldquo;grey&amp;rdquo; is just because I am not familiar myself) of works that are relevant from both perspectives. In my folder &amp;ldquo;archive/projects_discussed/interesting_to_do/ok_lets_see/but_probably_not&amp;rdquo; there is an old modelling project aimed at comparing the diffusion of cultural traits under different selective biases (neutral, model-based, frequency-based, and content-based) in different population structures: fully-connected (the control condition, standard in cultural evolution), Erdos-Reyni random networks and Scale-free networks. As the name of the folder suggests, the project is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, one of the reasons that motivated me working on &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; was exactly the lack of integration between the two literatures. However, my unsatisfaction was going in the opposite direction. Research on online cultural dynamics was (and still is) dominated by the network/complexity science perspective. Whereas these works are computationally sophisticated, and some of them are illuminating, I have been sometimes frustrated by the lack (if not, worst, the implausibility) of the assumptions about individual psychology. My feeling is that many questionable ideas circulating about the negative effects of digital online media, e.g. the overestimation of &amp;ldquo;echo chambers&amp;rdquo; effects or of the influence of bots and misinformation, may have found support in the scientific literature because of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have been not explicit about that in the book and, as Andrew&amp;rsquo;s review rightly criticises, not particularly constructive, but the hope (implausible, I admit) was that researchers from the network/complexity science perspective would integrate some of the ideas in their models. But perhaps it is up to us. Interdisciplinarity is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am finishing the work on the submission of a modelling paper about cultural attraction theory (the preprint, quite different from the current version, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/vjcq3/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I thought I could go back after a while to a darling of this blog. Writing down these few musings is mostly useful for me, but perhaps they can be interesting for the people that already know the diatribe - the post is hardly a crowd-pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, my general position is more or less stable on what I wrote five (!) years ago together with Alex Mesoudi (&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-015-9490-2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, even if I have a different opinion on many specific points) and, more recently, in the first half of the &amp;ldquo;Transmitting and sharing&amp;rdquo; chapter of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. The points carried forward by cultural attraction theory are valuable and overlooked in much cultural evolution research, so it is important to pay attention to them. Convergent transformation can, as much as faithful copying, bring about cultural stability. Explaining the diffusion of a trait with &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; - a tendency to copy others faithfully - is to assume what requires itself an explanation. We copy the majority, the successful, the elders: until we do not. Individual and social learning are not two different processes, and, yes, I now think that culture &amp;ldquo;is a property, not a thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, hi-fi copying is important in some domains, and there is a limit to what convergent transformations can achieve. Cultural transmission does allow for the diffusion of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; information that can not be reconstructed. Cultural attraction people are correct, technically, when they say that high-fidelity transmission is a special case of attraction, with reconstruction equal to zero, or something analogous. However, I believe that the advantages linked to the generality of a theory depend on what we are trying to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My position is annoying as I guess I end up to slightly irritating both camps, but, despite what you heard on Twitter, academics are (mostly) a bunch of nice people, and I tend to be able to work with both the factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I became more and more convinced that the main reason for the disagreement resides in the fact that different people ask different &amp;ldquo;deep&amp;rdquo; questions about culture. Thom Scott-Phillips says something similar &lt;a href=&#34;https://thomscottphillips.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/scott-phillips-2016-review-of-lewens.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (at the end of section 2). Many cultural evolutionists are interested to explain what is so special in humans, and the answer is, correctly: culture, as they define it. Many cultural attractionists (?), instead, are interested to explain why some cultural traits are succesfull, given the state of the world and of its inhabitants. Again, I tend to share the latter interest but, of course, both questions are legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar way to put it is that many cultural attractionists are humanists (as in researchers working in the humanities) or social scientists that become frustrated with non-scientific explanations of culture, and pushed interdisciplinarity towards hard sciences. Many cultural evolutionists are instead natural scientists that &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; that culture is important to explain human and, up to a point, non-human behaviour, and pushed  interdisciplinarity the other way around. This does not need to be literally true - people actually following the exact career path - but it seems to me it catches an interesting difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most controversial, cultural attraction theory stresses (recently with more emphasis) that factors of attraction are multifaceted and, in particular, not only cognitive. Again, for the internal consistency of the theory, this is perfectly right. Personally, I met cultural attraction theory (which was called, at the time, &amp;ldquo;epidemiology of representations&amp;rdquo;) reading Dan Sperber&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Explaining-Culture-Naturalistic-Dan-Sperber/dp/0631200452&#34;&gt;Explaining Culture&lt;/a&gt;, and this changed my scientific life (and, as a consequence, if I look at it from today&amp;rsquo;s perspective, my life tout-court). While the book is the classic source for the &amp;ldquo;factors of attraction can be psychological and ecological&amp;rdquo; motto, it is also home of chapters on culture and mental (massive) modularity, anthropology and psychology, etc. For me, at least, there was a clear message that pan-human cognitive similarities constrain the forms that cultures can take, and contribute to explaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently on how these cognitive similarities are implemented and on how they arise, I still believe that cultural attraction theory is more &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; if this message is true, and I would not shy away from that. For reconstruction and convergent transformation to provide satisfying explanations, they should be reconducted to a coherent something else, whatever this will be. Of course, the importance of these constraints is variable and domain-dependent, so that in some cases we should prefer reconstruction-based explanations, and in others preservative-transmission-based explanations, but that is, I believe, a stimulating empirical problem for cultural evolutionists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sichuan food and the transience of traditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my secret passion (or not-so-secret, if you know me a bit) is cooking. Last weekend was devoted to the new edition of Fuchsia Dunlop&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Sichuan-Fuchsia-Dunlop/dp/1324004835&#34;&gt;The Food of Sichuan&lt;/a&gt;, widely considered as one of the best western-accessible resource on the topic. If you want to know, I cooked &amp;lsquo;Strange Flavour&amp;rsquo; Bang Bang Chicken and Fish-Fragrant Aubergines. (Both will need much improvement&amp;mdash;for example I ended up burning the peanuts while deep-frying them&amp;hellip;&amp;mdash; so if I ever happen to offer to cook you Sichuan food, ask for my only piece of resistance so far, the classic Mapo Tofu.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has a fairly good historical introduction, where a few things caught my eye. Sure, the cuisine of Sichuan is renowned for its variety, and for the ability to combine several ingredients to create distinctive flavour combinations, but at the end of the day many of us will appreciate it for the signature &amp;ldquo;hot-and-numbing&amp;rdquo; taste given by the combination of Sichuan pepper (in the picture below) and abundant serving of chillies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at odd with my intuitive idea of a millennia-old culinary tradition, chillies obviously &amp;ldquo;only reached China in the late sixteenth century [&amp;hellip;] probably brought to China by Portuguese traders&amp;rdquo;. The &lt;em&gt;barbarian peppers&lt;/em&gt; were considered an ornamental plant: &amp;ldquo;it would be at least another century before the use of chillies to flavour food was documented&amp;rdquo;. According to this account, &amp;ldquo;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796-1820)&amp;rdquo; that the plant was established as a local crop in Sichuan, that is, two centuries ago. Deep-frying, which I associated intimately with Chinese cuisine, seems even more recent in Sichuan: &amp;ldquo;an interest in deep-frying [&amp;hellip;] is said to have come from Americans in 1930s Chongqing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of my previous research about Swedish food. (Yes, when living in Stockholm I had a blog about Swedish food, alas only in Italian, but you can have a look at some popular post, for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucinasvedeseperitaliani.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/surstromming/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucinasvedeseperitaliani.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/kottbullar/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Many classic recipes of the Swedish traditions were, in fact, the results of a few successful recipe books that appeared after the Second World War and canonised the &lt;em&gt;Husmanskost&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; home-cooked Swedish food. Traditional is in quotation marks not by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is an Italian classic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonara&#34;&gt;pasta alla carbonara&lt;/a&gt;. Some even speculate that it was invented to please American soldiers during the liberation of Rome in 1944, by reminding them of their eggs and bacon breakfasts. Whatever this is true or not (it looks too good to be true though), the recipe is never mentioned before the Second World War, suggesting a recent origin. By the way: no onions and no cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe many other examples can be found for &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; dishes. This is of course nothing new. Another of my not-so-secrets is that I had a classic anthropological formation, and, in socio-cultural anthropology, that traditions are often &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Invention_of_Tradition.html?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&#34;&gt;invented&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Imagined_Communities.html?id=nQ9jXXJV-vgC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;imagined&lt;/a&gt; is common currency. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kSukCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=how+traditions+live+and+day&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRkqKZu9DlAhWtTxUIHY53AtkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=how%20traditions%20live%20and%20day&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;How Traditions Live and Die&lt;/a&gt; Olivier Morin makes an analogous point using the example of Highland&amp;rsquo;s clans tartans, that were single-handedly created by a fabric producer in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other traditions may be indeed millennia old. For example, Sara Graça da Silva and Jamie Tehrani used &lt;a href=&#34;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150645&#34;&gt;phylogenetic methods&lt;/a&gt; to analyse the relationships between folktales in Indo-European-speaking societies, and they claim to have found &amp;ldquo;evidence that one tale (‘The Smith and the Devil’) can be traced back to the Bronze Age&amp;rdquo;. The point is: we should be wary of considering traditions as, by-default, ancient and robust (perhaps because of an inborn tendency to copy others). Some may be, and others may be not. I wonder whether cultural evolutionists, beside Morin&amp;rsquo;s book and a less recent, and not very well-known I believe, book from Pascal Boyer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Tradition_as_Truth_and_Communication.html?id=Wuf2PXR1pBgC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Tradition as Truth and Communication&lt;/a&gt;), have explored in detail the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more general reflection: a backbone of cultural evolution is population thinking, which implies that culture is an emergent, population-level, product of individual interactions, and individual interactions are where the causal magic happens (at least, this is how I read it). From this perspective, it looks natural to think to cultural traditions in a non-essentialist way: they are just the temporary result of individual interactions, looked at on a certain zoom level. However, sometimes &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; is essentialised and used itself as an explanation, as in &amp;ldquo;we do it &lt;em&gt;because of our culture&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. These kinds of explanations are more and more present when reporting and justifying transcultural experiments (a good criticism of this notion of culture is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/18/3-4/article-p231_1.xml&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; from Lawrence Hirschfeld). Transcultural experiments are important and necessary, but we need to be cautious when we say that &amp;ldquo;eastern people&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the Aka&amp;rdquo;, or any other experimental group, behave differently because of &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo;. It could be, but it could also be that many, interrelated, possibly short-lived, traditions create a specific situation, and it would be interesting to be able to disentangle these possibilities. Anthropologists (in anthropology the WEIRD problem is as a minumum a century-old one: a true tradition!) have recognised this problem, but the solutions proposed have not been, in my opinion, particularly successful, but this may be material for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wellcome Trust has recently (yesterday) released the 2018 &lt;a href=&#34;https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018&#34;&gt;Global Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a 140,000 people survey on how ‘people around the world think and feel about science and major health challenges’. Among the many interesting pieces of information, not surprisingly, attitudes towards vaccinations are starting to be widely discussed in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/survey-shows-crisis-of-confidence-in-vaccines-in-parts-of-europe&#34;&gt;press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first important thing to notice, as the Wellcome Trust correctly does, is that ‘worldwide, 79% of people agree that vaccines are safe and 84% agree that they are effective’ and ‘92% of parents worldwide said that their children have received a vaccine to prevent them from getting childhood diseases .’ Whatever we may think, the majority of people around the world rightly believe that vaccines are good. Of course, there is a minority of people, especially in western countries, that is less convinced of that. Citing again the Wellcome Trust, ‘In France, one in three people disagree that vaccines are safe, the highest percentage for any country worldwide’. The France figure is, however, one of few outliers, also for western countries, where the averages of people disagreeing that vaccines are safe are around 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, that one out of ten persons in western countries could think as such is worrying. Not surprisingly, social media has been identified as one of the culprits of this situation, and I bet that, following the Wellcome Trust survey, the trend will continue (I already found one article &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/anti-vaxx-vaccination-myth-poll-europe-pro-nature-birth-a8964441.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Out of curiosity, I correlated the Wellcome trust data with recent data on social media penetration/usage in Europe, and they are not correlated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./social_media.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was on it, I also correlated the data with the importance of religion..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./religion.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;the trust in science&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./science.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and the GDP pro capita&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./gdp.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this is a very basic analysis. It could be for example that, within countries, people that are sceptical of vaccines use more social media than others. That anti-vaxx information spreads effectively in social media is not surprising. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(15)00197-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661315001977%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&#34;&gt;many reasons&lt;/a&gt; why anti-vaccination beliefs are easy to spread (and, conversely, it could be more difficult with pro-vaccination beliefs). Information around vaccines is psychologically attractive, involving potentially disgust and counterintuitive concepts that, coupled with a possible negative bias, make fearmongering on vaccines a good topic for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y&#34;&gt;online misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. All of this, however, is not a prerogative of digital social media (where correct, pro-vaccine, information &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2670250&#34;&gt;also spreads effectively&lt;/a&gt;), and vaccine hesitancy is &lt;a href=&#34;http://sethmnookin.com/the-panic-virus/&#34;&gt;as old as vaccines themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, each time you hear someone saying, or writing, that anti-vaccination beliefs are linked to social media you should be sceptical. At least: it is not obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, all the technical stuff (data, R script, what I coded exactly as “vaccine hesitancy”, “social media penetration”, etc.) are in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/vaccines-wellcome&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is cultural evolution “neoliberal”?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been involved, over the weekend, in a small twitter debate on the old question of whether anthropology should use qualitative or quantitative methodologies. The debate was not particularly interesting by itself (I had many, probably too many, similar conversations starting when I was an undergraduate student) and the readers of this blog know, or suspect, my position, so I am not dwelling on it. There is, however, a marginal aspect that made me think a bit: I have the feeling that, when it is all said and done, the negative attitudes toward quantifications are linked to the idea that quantifying human culture is politically “neoliberal”, if not altogether “right-wing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that no critic of quantification in anthropology will accept this as their own position and they will express more cogent (at least from their point of view) arguments. It does not matter: I am happy to explore a straw man here. (A tweet that was stating it explicitly appeared at some point over the weekend, and it was “liked” by one of the persons involved in the debate, but that is just a side-note, a “like” on Twitter does not need to mean anything.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas I can grasp why some evolutionary approaches can be considered as supporting neoliberal social policies – even though I think the question is more nuanced and complicated – how can quantification by itself be? Is studying &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0106565&#34;&gt;how movies influence the popularity of dog breeds&lt;/a&gt; neoliberal? Is it &lt;em&gt;counting&lt;/em&gt; how many different &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(16)30274-4/fulltext&#34;&gt;folktales&lt;/a&gt; there are in different populations? Is cultural evolution, intended as a general project of applying scientific and quantitative methods to the study of culture, neoliberal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with rhetorical questions, but I would be interested if anybody knows any scholarly reference or developed argument that support this position (again, I know, it is a straw man). The only reason I can think of is that, in the last decades, researchers working on quantitative approaches to culture have been less active in political matters than researchers working on qualitative approaches, even though my impression is that the formers are politically leaning left as much as the rest of social scientists (at least the people that refer to the “cultural evolution” label).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really not interested in starting a debate, but perhaps there are reasons for considering quantification as such, and I’d be happy to exploit collective intelligence to know more (as said, possibly in the form of scholarly publications, etc.). Ok, I am going back to my R codes now.
