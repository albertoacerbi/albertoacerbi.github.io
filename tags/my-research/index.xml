      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With unsurprising regularity, new &amp;ldquo;scandals&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;shocking&amp;rdquo; information about social media appear in the press, and, of course, in social media themselves. Lately, Facebook seems to be the main target. (Incidentally, why Facebook? My hunch is that academics and journalists, which are the main producers and consumers of this information, tend to not be Facebook users, so it feels less dissonant to think it is the real baddy. If only &lt;em&gt;the others&lt;/em&gt; would understand it! &amp;hellip;Anyway, this is not very important for the rest of the post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, around one month ago, the Washington Post &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1433749542474747910&#34;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;Misinformation on Facebook got six times more clicks than factual news during the 2020 election&amp;rdquo;. The news was, of course, a hit. However, the &amp;ldquo;six times&amp;rdquo; figure seems at odds with much recent literature that shows that, when considered together with the total information present, the amount of misinformation circulating in social media &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau2706&#34;&gt;is&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aay3539&#34;&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aau4586&#34;&gt;modest&lt;/a&gt;, something like the 5% of the total information (often less). For this reason, it would have been interesting to know how the &amp;ldquo;clicks&amp;rdquo; were actually calculated or what was exactly considered as &amp;ldquo;misinformation&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately the study to which the Washington Post referred to was not out at the moment, and it is still, after one month, not available (not even in form of preprint, which is now relatively standard practice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on &amp;mdash; mid September &amp;mdash; another scandal hit Facebook. This time, it was leaked documents to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline&#34;&gt;the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;, titled &amp;ldquo;Facebook Knows Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls, Company Documents Show&amp;rdquo;. You probably heard about it, and about the outraged editorials and comments all around social media: you have here a bad social media company (i) hiding information, and (ii) harming (iii) young girls. Hardly you can have something more attractive. However, it looks like the report was mostly based on a small survey on a few dozens of teenagers that were asked if they &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; Instagram was bad for them, and on &amp;ldquo;focus groups&amp;rdquo; with even less participants, where the reason why they thought it was bad were discussed in more details. Now, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(20)30251-5&#34;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10226.short&#34;&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562%20018%200506%201?mod=article_inline&#34;&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; to have an in-depth knowledge of the effects of Instagram and social media on well-being and mental health, but this survey does not add much to our previous knowledge, so it is difficult to justify the reactions. (A good analysis of the vicissitude can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://unherd.com/2021/09/facebooks-bad-science/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move on to today, and we have the whistleblower Frances Haugen, ex Facebook employee, testifying in front of the US congress. Things get heated, outrage continues, with public personalities pushing on Twitter the sober hashtag &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SachaBaronCohen/status/1445541488889241608&#34;&gt;#FacebookKills&lt;/a&gt;. I admit I did not read the full transcriptions (I am already using precious time by writing this blog post instead of working or, even better, having a walk, as Bristol is sunny in October!), and I am referring to reports from newspapers, in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/facebook-harms-children-damaging-democracy-claims-whistleblower&#34;&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. From what I understand, there are not really big novelties in what the whistleblower reports. She is mostly repeating the accusations that Facebook knew about harming children and teenagers (but see the point above), adding various dubious twists. One is the analogy between social media usage and addiction (I cite: &amp;ldquo;It’s just like cigarettes&amp;hellip;teenagers don&amp;rsquo;t have good self-regulation.&amp;quot;), which is considered &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/blog/social-media-is-nothing-like-drugs-despite-all-the-horror-stories/&#34;&gt;flawed&lt;/a&gt; by practically all researchers in the field. Another is the idea, never &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/118/32/e2101967118&#34;&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-021-09734-6&#34;&gt;established&lt;/a&gt;, that the algorithm is pushing towards more extreme content (the algorithm &amp;ldquo;led children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes&amp;hellip;all the way to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time&amp;rdquo;). We have gory details (&amp;ldquo;women would be walking around with brittle bones in 60 years’ time because of the anorexia-related content they found on Facebook platforms&amp;rdquo; in the words of the Guardian), and not very surprising considerations, such as that Facebook &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/03/former-facebook-employee-frances-haugen-identifies-herself-as-whistleblower&#34;&gt;put profits before people&lt;/a&gt; (huge if true for a private company). In sum, nothing really new and, mostly, from what I get, nothing that can be actually used to understand better what is going on, a part the usual accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am not in the &amp;ldquo;everything is good as it is&amp;rdquo; team (I do not think anybody is), and there are several things that Facebook and other social media should do to makes things better. A short and idiosyncratic list could include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making their data available and easy to access to researchers and to the general public. Twitter seems slightly better than Facebook about that. (Adding to what said above, Facebook got caught recently in other &amp;ldquo;scandals&amp;rdquo; about errors in sharing data and blocking access to scientists.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No social media, that I am aware, is open about the algorithm they use to present information to users. How our Facebook news feed is decided? What about Twitter? I find the lack of transparency particularly worrying, also because this information would finally allow to give better answers to central questions on the kind of information promoted by social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could we make social media better? We could and we certainly should experiment with alternatives. If it is true (see the point above) that, say, social media algorithms push contents that receive more interactions (I called it &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;optimisation for shallow engagement&lt;/a&gt;) and, say &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs42761-021-00046-w&#34;&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt; or strongly &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/114/28/7313.long&#34;&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; content receive more interactions, this could created a vicious circle where negative (say) information receive more interactions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; are proposed more, so end up to dominate social media content. But, of course, things are complicated. Many other factors could be relevant (again, we would need to know more about the algorithm!) and, importantly, preferences for negative (say) information could be linked to more general cognitive preferences and be &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/br56y/&#34;&gt;succesfull&lt;/a&gt; independently from social media, so that one would need to balance algorithmic and psychological forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes clearly beyond my expertise, but putting Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook (and what else?) in the same hands may not be a good idea. I leave this to people that know more, but it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; that a decentralised system would work better for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on and on. All these are, I think, very reasonable criticisms to Facebook and other social media, and I&amp;rsquo;d be (and am) very supportive of calls to action in this direction. Now, it could be that the periodic outrages are useful, but, call me crazy, I am not sure about that. If one claims that #FacebookKills, it is very easy for Facebook to show that it does not and, well, they are right. The risk is that by muddling sensitive requests with sensationalist claims, we are doing Facebook&amp;rsquo;s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ps: I may be too old, so &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jFqhjaGh30&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; the title reference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Individual-based models of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_ibm_cultevo/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_ibm_cultevo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have been asked by a few people where they could start if they wanted to learn how to do individual-based models (IBMs) of cultural evolution. I never had a good answer, so, together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://marcosmolla.com&#34;&gt;Marco Smolla&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed it would have been interesting to develop some material, in a form of a long tutorial, or a book (at that time, conferences were still in person&amp;hellip;). While doing some research, I quickly found that &lt;a href=&#34;https://marcosmolla.com&#34;&gt;Alex Mesoudi&lt;/a&gt; had already put together some basic R Markdown IBMs with the same goal, so we happily joined forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/&#34;&gt;Individual-based model of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/introduction.html&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/a&gt; quickly explains the whys, whats, and hows of the book, and I would suggest to start from there if you are intersted. Some main points here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is intended for people with a basic R knowledge that want to learn cultural evolution IBMs &lt;em&gt;by doing&lt;/em&gt;. We cut most of the theoretical complexities of modelling (some references can be found in the Introduction) and focused on reproducing existent models, explaining the code almost line-by-line. In sum, this is not a book you want to read on the couch in front of the fire, but on your desk in front of an RStudio window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We choose to use R (and, with some licence, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;tidyverse&lt;/a&gt;) not because is the best programming language for IBMs, but because is probably the most diffuse at the moment among researchers in cultural evolution. The idea is that, if one already knows R, the additional cost of learning IBMs is relatively limited, as opposed to starting from scratch with a new programming language. (And, anyway, I am too old to learn Julia.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book builds in complexity, both from the programming and the conceptual point of view. We start with IBMs versions of the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; cultural evolution analytical models, assuming that most of the readers will be at least familiar with their verbal descriptions, and we then move to more recent, or less standard, topics. They include Roger&amp;rsquo;s paradox and its solutions, how to model the effects of demography and migrations, social networks, the importance of convergent transformations, etc. A full table of content is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/IBM-cultevo/blob/main/README.md&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to be generally consistent with programming style, conventions, etc. (see again the Introduction), but we also use, especially in the later chapters, different programming techniques so that readers can see how things can be done differently. This should expand the programming knowledge - or simply be confusing. Feedback is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the code-heavy nature of the book, the best way to use it is from the Bookdown-generated html version, available &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where the code can be easily copied-and-pasted. The R Markdown files that build the book can be find &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/IBM-cultevo&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you prefer to work directly on those. There is also a pdf version &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/32v6a/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but, as said above, the html version is advised. Also, some of the code did not render well in the pdf, so you may need both in any case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the html version of the book is, and will always be, open access. We have a doi that can be used to cite it, and we are discussing some options to also have a &amp;ldquo;proper&amp;rdquo; publisher for a physical, paper-based, version, but nothing has been planned yet. In fact, if someone has any advice, they are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: happy modelling, and remember the book is a first complete draft, but still a draft, so we expect to change and improve bits and pieces in a collaborative effort!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Covid misinformation on mainstream Italian media</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_covid_misinfo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_covid_misinfo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have heard the we live in a post-truth era, that we are facing an infodemic or, even, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6523/1395&#34;&gt;syndemic&lt;/a&gt;, the combination of &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; epidemics, meaning that covid &amp;ldquo;emerged in an information ecosystem that helps misinformation and lies spread faster than scientific evidence, weakening our ability to respond to new threats&amp;rdquo;. Not only this is not true but, I believe, is also a dangerous narrative that makes us focus on the wrong problems instead of the real ones. Anyway, this is not a topic I can elaborate on here (hey, I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_oup/&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; - partly - about that!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; misinformation does spread. Another aspect of these stale criticism is that, naturally, the culprit is social media. Luckily, many real experts of media have long recognised the contribution, or in fact the prominent role, that mainstream, traditional, media have in the current spread of misinformation. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rasmus_kleis&#34;&gt;Rasmus Kleis Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, director of Reuters Institute at Oxford University, reports on Twitter several examples of mainstream media, or prominent political figures, spreading or originating false or misleading information: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=Misinformation%20often%20comes%20from%20the%20top&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34;&gt;Misinformation often comes from the top&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Italian living in UK, with part of my family living in Italy, I have been irritated by how the major Italian newspaper (for number of readers), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.repubblica.it&#34;&gt;La Repubblica&lt;/a&gt;, covered the last days of news from UK. But I noticed the disservice before, so hang with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;maria.png&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 15th of November, La Repubblica - I repeat, the major Italian newspaper - covered the declarations of don Livio Fanzaga, the director of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Maria&#34;&gt;Radio Maria&lt;/a&gt;, a large Catholic radio, which, among others, claimed that &amp;ldquo;Coronavirus is a conspiracy under the impulse of Satan&amp;rdquo;, with the goal of &amp;ldquo;building a new world without God&amp;rdquo;. Now, why a major newspaper should report the delusional beliefs of a not very important figure? In addition, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/11/15/news/radio_maria_il_coronavirus_e_un_complotto_sotto_l_impulso_di_satana_-274486827/&#34;&gt;the whole article&lt;/a&gt; there is not a single comment from the journalist on the declarations. If I remember correctly, but I can not check now, the article was linked from the first page of the online version (why??) and the declarations were reported as &amp;ldquo;controversial&amp;rdquo;, which is, clearly, not the right word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./vaccine.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9th of December, in the first days of the successful roll-out of the UK vaccine (our local medical practice texted us yesterday that the first 1,000 people have been vaccinated in our Bristol &lt;em&gt;neighbourhood&lt;/em&gt;), La Repubblica reported, as full-page headline of the online version, the news about the two allergic reactions among the early people vaccinated. Now, this is technically not false, but it is an expected consequence of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; vaccines. It was quickly reported in other international newspapers (as it should be) and quickly forgotten (as it should be). Putting this news as full-page headline, when we should all strive to understand how to convince &amp;ldquo;hesitant&amp;rdquo; people and reassure everybody about the vaccine, is not only bad journalism, but it could have dangerous consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./UK1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrive to Sunday, after the declaration of the stricter Christmas lockdown for some areas in UK, the new strain, and the stop of flights from UK to Italy. It is a worrying situation, so what does the major Italian newspaper do? Again, full-page headline. The summary contains an anonymous quote: &amp;ldquo;We run away. The situation in London is out of control&amp;rdquo;. While health secretary Matt Hancock did say that the new variant (not &amp;ldquo;the situation in London&amp;rdquo;) was &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-in-tier-4-everybody-needs-to-behave-as-if-they-already-have-coronavirus-matt-hancock-says-12168124&#34;&gt;out of control&lt;/a&gt;, he certainly did not say anything about running away from London, so it is not clear what the quote refers to. But, beside the details, it is clearly made up, explicitly or not, to scare readers (a strategy often used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y&#34;&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived to the title that today made me writing this post instead of doing something more festive: &amp;ldquo;Chaos in UK, you even have to do the tests by yourself!&amp;quot;. Summary: &amp;ldquo;It is a jungle there, that&amp;rsquo;s why there has been an out-of-control diffusion&amp;rdquo;. The major italian newspaper. A (supposedly) serious, left-leaning, large circulation newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a supporter of the current UK government, and I have plenty of criticisms on their Covid management, but: you can &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; whether to do the swab yourself or with an assistant (parents always do it for children) and this is because people &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to do it by themselves instead of having someone else doing it to them. UK tested, from the beginning of October, between 300,000 and 400,000 people every day, which is double of triple of what Italy did. We had a test for our daughter (she had a fever for few days): we booked it online in the evening on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/get-coronavirus-test&#34;&gt;nhs website&lt;/a&gt;, we got a slot for the next morning, we did it in 10 minutes and we had the result (negative!) the day after. Hardly chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to comment on the rest, that is, implying that the &amp;ldquo;out-of-control diffusion&amp;rdquo;, which I guess refers to the new strain, is due to the fact that here is a &amp;ldquo;jungle&amp;rdquo;. Not much to say: mutations can happen anywhere (as they did and do). Not to mentione that one of the reasons why the new mutation has been first found in UK is that UK does on average 56 genomic sequences for every 1,000 covid cases, against, for example, the 0.42 of Italy (data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://covidcg.org/?tab=global_sequencing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;: in other words, if the new strain would have been equally present in Italy and UK, everything else being equal, UK would have around 130 times more likelihood to detect it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude this rant-ish and quickly written post. It is disheartening how this journalism seems to be acceptable. Beside the academic thoughts, it can have important (see the vaccine example above) and real (Hi mum, I am good!) consequences. The fact that it goes together with the &amp;ldquo;social media are the culprit&amp;rdquo; slogan just makes it more unnerving. Anyway: check your news sources, stay safe wherever you are, and enjoy the holidays if you can!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural evolution in the digital age book club</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_ceda_book_club/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_ceda_book_club/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a short post to advertise and bookmark the book club that &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net&#34;&gt;cognitionandculture.net&lt;/a&gt; organised around &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-book-club/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Every now and then, the people at the International Cognition &amp;amp; Culture Institute (ICCI) choose a book of culture-and-cognition interest and invite the author to write a short précis and various experts on the topic to write commentaries (see some previous examples &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/ebooks&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  All is followed by an open online discussion: for &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; it starts today and will last until the 12th of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commentaries, by &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/are-humans-wary-learners/&#34;&gt;Alex Mesoudi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/what-is-the-recipe/&#34;&gt;Sacha Altay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/cultural-transmission-reinvention-and-progress/&#34;&gt;Olivier Morin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/consuming-vs-sharing-information-online/&#34;&gt;Hugo Mercier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/the-participatory-age/&#34;&gt;Mathieu Charbonneau&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/the-mystery-of-production/&#34;&gt;Pascal Boyer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/truth-is-not-always-the-point/&#34;&gt;Tiffany Morisseau&lt;/a&gt; are extremely insightful, and they should appeal to anybody interested in cultural evolution and especially in its application to contemporary online dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it sounds like a cliché, I will not get tired to repeat how privileged I feel about having &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; at the centre of such a stimulating exchange. Everybody is very welcome to &lt;a href=&#34;http://cognitionandculture.net/webinars/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-book-club-general-discussion/&#34;&gt;join the discussion&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural evolution and networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.andrewbuskell.com&#34;&gt;Andrew Buskell&lt;/a&gt; just published in &lt;em&gt;Acta Biotheoretica&lt;/em&gt; an insightful combined &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10441-020-09384-x&#34;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/&#34;&gt;Hugo Mercier&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/hugomercier/not-born-yesterday&#34;&gt;Not Born Yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. There are many things to appreciate in the review. First - but I may be biased here&amp;hellip; - it is a positive one. Andrew concludes by writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mercier and Acerbi&amp;rsquo;s volumes are enjoyable, story-driven journeys. They guide the reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way. They are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to the recent spate of epistemological doomsayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not have said it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it is pleasing to be in good company. &lt;em&gt;Not born yesterday&lt;/em&gt; is an excellent book. In fact, while writing, my own views about how social information is evaluated have somehow glided from a more standard cultural evolution framework to the epistemic (or &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo;) vigilance perspective presented in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s volume. If I would start working on &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; today it would probably be a quite different book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and last, the &amp;ldquo;concerns&amp;rdquo; are also perceptive. One of those is that &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; did not discuss enough the importance of the integration between the literature on social network models and the largely individual-level perspective endorsed in the book. I completely agree. The main theoretical perspectives I drew upon are indeed not particularly sensitive to the topic. Evolutionary psychology theories are mostly theories about individual minds, and while social interactions and communications are certainly important for these theories, they are important with respect to how they shaped those individual minds. (Incidentally, I always thought the evolutionary psychology is one of the approaches that would have more to gain by adopting a modelling perspective, but only very few evolutionary psychology works use it.) Cultural evolution seems more receptive: virtually all theories in cultural evolution take into account population-level dynamics, still populations are generally considered as uniform or - I think - fully-connected networks, i.e. networks were all individuals have the same probability to interact with any other individual in the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are exceptions. At least a &lt;a href=&#34;https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw0609&#34;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13109&#34;&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; adopt an explicit &amp;ldquo;cultural evolution on networks&amp;rdquo; perspective and there is an enormous grey area (the &amp;ldquo;grey&amp;rdquo; is just because I am not familiar myself) of works that are relevant from both perspectives. In my folder &amp;ldquo;archive/projects_discussed/interesting_to_do/ok_lets_see/but_probably_not&amp;rdquo; there is an old modelling project aimed at comparing the diffusion of cultural traits under different selective biases (neutral, model-based, frequency-based, and content-based) in different population structures: fully-connected (the control condition, standard in cultural evolution), Erdos-Reyni random networks and Scale-free networks. As the name of the folder suggests, the project is still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, one of the reasons that motivated me working on &lt;em&gt;Cultural evolution in the digital age&lt;/em&gt; was exactly the lack of integration between the two literatures. However, my unsatisfaction was going in the opposite direction. Research on online cultural dynamics was (and still is) dominated by the network/complexity science perspective. Whereas these works are computationally sophisticated, and some of them are illuminating, I have been sometimes frustrated by the lack (if not, worst, the implausibility) of the assumptions about individual psychology. My feeling is that many questionable ideas circulating about the negative effects of digital online media, e.g. the overestimation of &amp;ldquo;echo chambers&amp;rdquo; effects or of the influence of bots and misinformation, may have found support in the scientific literature because of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I have been not explicit about that in the book and, as Andrew&amp;rsquo;s review rightly criticises, not particularly constructive, but the hope (implausible, I admit) was that researchers from the network/complexity science perspective would integrate some of the ideas in their models. But perhaps it is up to us. Interdisciplinarity is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sentiment analysis of song lyrics by genre</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_mxm_genres/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_mxm_genres/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/cultural-evolution-of-emotional-expression-in-50-years-of-song-lyrics/E6E64C02BDB0480DB13B8B6BB7DFF598/core-reader&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lottybrand.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Lotty Brand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://alexmesoudi.com&#34;&gt;Alex Mesoudi&lt;/a&gt;, we documented how the lyrics of popular songs have become sadder in the last few decades. The proportion of words with positive emotional content has decreased and, on the contrary, the proportion of words with negative emotional content has increased, on average, from the 1960s to now. (If you are a reader of this blog you probably already know about all that - if not, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/ideas/why-are-pop-songs-getting-sadder-than-they-used-to-be&#34;&gt;this aeon piece&lt;/a&gt; for more about the research).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people have suggested that this could be mainly due to the fact that new - sadder or angrier - genres (for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/02/pop-songs-are-getting-sadder-and-angrier.html&#34;&gt;hip-hop&lt;/a&gt;) have replaced the genres dominant fifty years ago. This is a sensible hypothesis. In one of the two datasets we used for the main analysis (indicated in the paper as &amp;ldquo;mxm&amp;rdquo; dataset), derived from the lyrics in the website &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.musixmatch.com&#34;&gt;musixmatch.com&lt;/a&gt;, songs are also tagged with their genre, so it was relatively straightforward to explore the contribution of each genre to the general trend. The R code and the outputs are available in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/mxm_genres_analysis&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, here the general trends for the &amp;ldquo;mxm&amp;rdquo; dataset. (If you are interested, we explain in the aeon piece linked above what the facts that these numbers are small and that the proportion of negative emotion-words is anyway always lower than the proportion of positive emotion-words mean for the importance of the trends.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./mxm_all.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the genre analysis, there are 168 possible genre tags in the dataset, on a total of 159,015 songs, but the most common 20 genres account for 99% of all songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./genres.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are clear difference in the emotional tone of lyrics in different genres, and they correspond to the general intuition: among the &lt;em&gt;sad&lt;/em&gt; genres there are indeed recently emerged ones, such as &amp;ldquo;Heavy Metal&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Punk&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Hip Hop/Rap&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Indie Rock&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;Alternative&amp;rdquo;. (&amp;ldquo;Holiday&amp;rdquo;, the more positive and less negative genre, is basically the Spotify Christmas playlist of your dreams - or nightmares perhaps.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./overall_emo_genres.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also look at the prevalence of genres through years. Genres like &amp;ldquo;Alternative&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Heavy Metal&amp;rdquo; did indeed grew in popularity, whereas they were completely absent in the 1960s. On the contrary, positively-connotated genres like &amp;ldquo;R&amp;amp;B/Soul&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Christian &amp;amp; Gospel&amp;rdquo; show a strong decrease. Notice &amp;ldquo;Hip Hop/Rap&amp;rdquo; does not appear as growing too much in this dataset, which implies that is not the cause of the increase of negative emotion in lyrics (&lt;em&gt;in this dataset&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that there is some truth in the idea that the overall increase in sadness is due to the emergence of new, sadder, genres. Genres like &amp;ldquo;Alternative&amp;rdquo;, for example, did not show any trend, but their &amp;ldquo;baseline&amp;rdquo;, so to speak, corresponds well to the current levels of negative/positive emotions overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./mxm_Alternative.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Heavy Metal&amp;rdquo;, consistently with the stereotype, is indeed, on average, a sad genre - as I said on Twitter, &amp;ldquo;unsurprising sentiment analysis results are good sentiment analysis results&amp;rdquo;. In fact, in 2010, the proportion of words expressing negative emotions was &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; than the proportion of words expressing positive emotions, going beyond the overall results (and showing that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/112/8/2389&#34;&gt;Polyanna principle&lt;/a&gt; does not hold everywhere&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./mxm_Heavy_Metal.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can see that also &amp;ldquo;Rock&amp;rdquo; and Pop&amp;rdquo;, the two most popular genres in the 1960s and still accounting for more than 30% of the total number of songs in 2010, show clear trends going in the overall direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./mxm_Rock.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./mxm_Pop.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the overall trend is not only imputable to the introduction of new genres, but that also &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; genres have become sadder. In the same &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/mxm_genres_analysis&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;, you can find the correspondent plots for all the 20 genres analysed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sentiment analysis of Child Ballads&#39; lyrics</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_child_ballads/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_child_ballads/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently published, together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lottybrand.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Lotty Brand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://alexmesoudi.com&#34;&gt;Alex Mesoudi&lt;/a&gt;, a paper studying the expression of emotions in the lyrics of the last 50 years of English-language pop songs - open access &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/cultural-evolution-of-emotional-expression-in-50-years-of-song-lyrics/E6E64C02BDB0480DB13B8B6BB7DFF598/core-reader&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We try to explain two related empirical findings: the frequency of words with positive emotional content decreases and, on the contrary, the frequency of words with negative emotional content increases in song lyrics. (Both by roughly one third. If, for example, the average song in 1960s had 30 words associated with negative emotion, the average song in 2010s has 40, assuming that they have the same total number of words.) This is a specific aspect of a relatively well-known phenomenon, that has been measured in various ways: pop songs have become sadder in the last decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we added in the paper is an attempt of explaining why this happened. We looked for cultural influences, such as upcoming artists copying the emotional tone from successful, or prestigious, artists of the previous years, but we did not find they were able to explain the pattern. We found, instead, that a general preference for songs with more negative lyrics, coupled with &amp;ldquo;unbiased transmission&amp;rdquo;, i.e. upcoming artists copying at random from the artists of the previous years, could explain it. Of course, upcoming artists do not &amp;ldquo;copy at random&amp;rdquo;: unbiased transmission stands for many unknown processes that cumulatively appear similar to genetic drift, where songs tend to &amp;ldquo;inherit&amp;rdquo; from one year to the other some of their features. The effect of unbiased transmission is important in our statistical model, but unbiased transmission is non-directional, so that a preference for negative lyrics, even if weak, can drive the process. We also wrote a popular piece about it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/ideas/why-are-pop-songs-getting-sadder-than-they-used-to-be&#34;&gt;aeon&lt;/a&gt;, where we explain more in detail all that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting question for me is then why, if there is a general preference for negative lyrics, we observe a &lt;em&gt;trend&lt;/em&gt; toward sadder songs or, in other words, why songs in the 1960s, at the beginning of our datasets, were happier? There are many possible answers here: one, that I thought possible, was that in the middle of last century songs were artificially, so to say, happier, possibly because of more control from centralised broadcasting networks, producers, and similar. It could have been possible that, if few people in the key positions wanted to push happier songs, they could succeed. Or at least, their work would have been easier than now, when we have access to more options, from private radio to recorded tape cassettes to, obviously, Spotify and co. In sum, access to more options allows people to listen to the music they &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to test this idea? An immediate prediction is that older songs should be sadder than middle-of-last-century songs. After some searches, and a chat with &lt;a href=&#34;https://patrickesavage.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Pat Savage&lt;/a&gt;, I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Ballads&#34;&gt;Child Ballads&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of 305 traditional ballads, put together in the 19th century. The datation of the ballads is problematic (even though most of them are probably from the 19th century), but the collection fits well in a not-very rigorous, but useful, category of &amp;ldquo;older&amp;rdquo; songs. I extracted the texts from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and performed the same sentiment analysis I have made for the recent pop songs. An obvious problem is that the sentiment analysis (&lt;a href=&#34;http://liwc.wpengine.com&#34;&gt;LIWC&lt;/a&gt;, dictionary-based) uses a contemporary lexicon, which may not be suitable for the analysis of old lyrics. A shortcut I used for this (very) exploratory analysis is to also check how many of the words in each songs were recognised by a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hunspell/vignettes/intro.html&#34;&gt;contemporary English dictionary&lt;/a&gt; and to use this figure to calculate the proportion of positive- and negative-emotion words. All the code is available in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/child_ballads_emo&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.     &lt;br&gt;
It looks my hypothesis was wrong. The proportion of words associated to emotions, both positive and negative, is more similar to the 1960s figure than to the contemporary one. In sum, old ballads are happier than contemporary pop songs, and in line with pop songs of fifty years ago. (In the plot below, &amp;ldquo;Billboard&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;mxm&amp;rdquo; are the two datasets we used to assess the sentiment of the last fifty years songs. More information in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/cultural-evolution-of-emotional-expression-in-50-years-of-song-lyrics/E6E64C02BDB0480DB13B8B6BB7DFF598/core-reader&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/ideas/why-are-pop-songs-getting-sadder-than-they-used-to-be&#34;&gt;aeon piece&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./positive.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./negative.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a very basic, and hardly rigorous, analysis. In my intuition old ballads are not exactly cheerful and breezy. Still, apparently, they are, at least when compared to contemporary pop lyrics. What to do with these results, I do not know. Are there more rigorous assessments of sentiment for old song lyrics around? Are Child ballads representative? Other ideas that can explain the contemporary trends? Feedback and advice are welcome as usual!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A few thoughts on cultural attraction</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_cultural_attraction/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_cultural_attraction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am finishing the work on the submission of a modelling paper about cultural attraction theory (the preprint, quite different from the current version, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/vjcq3/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I thought I could go back after a while to a darling of this blog. Writing down these few musings is mostly useful for me, but perhaps they can be interesting for the people that already know the diatribe - the post is hardly a crowd-pleaser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, my general position is more or less stable on what I wrote five (!) years ago together with Alex Mesoudi (&lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-015-9490-2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, even if I have a different opinion on many specific points) and, more recently, in the first half of the &amp;ldquo;Transmitting and sharing&amp;rdquo; chapter of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943?cc=gb&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. The points carried forward by cultural attraction theory are valuable and overlooked in much cultural evolution research, so it is important to pay attention to them. Convergent transformation can, as much as faithful copying, bring about cultural stability. Explaining the diffusion of a trait with &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; - a tendency to copy others faithfully - is to assume what requires itself an explanation. We copy the majority, the successful, the elders: until we do not. Individual and social learning are not two different processes, and, yes, I now think that culture &amp;ldquo;is a property, not a thing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, hi-fi copying is important in some domains, and there is a limit to what convergent transformations can achieve. Cultural transmission does allow for the diffusion of &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; information that can not be reconstructed. Cultural attraction people are correct, technically, when they say that high-fidelity transmission is a special case of attraction, with reconstruction equal to zero, or something analogous. However, I believe that the advantages linked to the generality of a theory depend on what we are trying to explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My position is annoying as I guess I end up to slightly irritating both camps, but, despite what you heard on Twitter, academics are (mostly) a bunch of nice people, and I tend to be able to work with both the factions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I became more and more convinced that the main reason for the disagreement resides in the fact that different people ask different &amp;ldquo;deep&amp;rdquo; questions about culture. Thom Scott-Phillips says something similar &lt;a href=&#34;https://thomscottphillips.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/scott-phillips-2016-review-of-lewens.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (at the end of section 2). Many cultural evolutionists are interested to explain what is so special in humans, and the answer is, correctly: culture, as they define it. Many cultural attractionists (?), instead, are interested to explain why some cultural traits are succesfull, given the state of the world and of its inhabitants. Again, I tend to share the latter interest but, of course, both questions are legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar way to put it is that many cultural attractionists are humanists (as in researchers working in the humanities) or social scientists that become frustrated with non-scientific explanations of culture, and pushed interdisciplinarity towards hard sciences. Many cultural evolutionists are instead natural scientists that &amp;ldquo;discovered&amp;rdquo; that culture is important to explain human and, up to a point, non-human behaviour, and pushed  interdisciplinarity the other way around. This does not need to be literally true - people actually following the exact career path - but it seems to me it catches an interesting difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, and perhaps most controversial, cultural attraction theory stresses (recently with more emphasis) that factors of attraction are multifaceted and, in particular, not only cognitive. Again, for the internal consistency of the theory, this is perfectly right. Personally, I met cultural attraction theory (which was called, at the time, &amp;ldquo;epidemiology of representations&amp;rdquo;) reading Dan Sperber&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Explaining-Culture-Naturalistic-Dan-Sperber/dp/0631200452&#34;&gt;Explaining Culture&lt;/a&gt;, and this changed my scientific life (and, as a consequence, if I look at it from today&amp;rsquo;s perspective, my life tout-court). While the book is the classic source for the &amp;ldquo;factors of attraction can be psychological and ecological&amp;rdquo; motto, it is also home of chapters on culture and mental (massive) modularity, anthropology and psychology, etc. For me, at least, there was a clear message that pan-human cognitive similarities constrain the forms that cultures can take, and contribute to explaining them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently on how these cognitive similarities are implemented and on how they arise, I still believe that cultural attraction theory is more &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; if this message is true, and I would not shy away from that. For reconstruction and convergent transformation to provide satisfying explanations, they should be reconducted to a coherent something else, whatever this will be. Of course, the importance of these constraints is variable and domain-dependent, so that in some cases we should prefer reconstruction-based explanations, and in others preservative-transmission-based explanations, but that is, I believe, a stimulating empirical problem for cultural evolutionists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sichuan food and the transience of traditions</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_sichuan/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_sichuan/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my secret passion (or not-so-secret, if you know me a bit) is cooking. Last weekend was devoted to the new edition of Fuchsia Dunlop&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Food-Sichuan-Fuchsia-Dunlop/dp/1324004835&#34;&gt;The Food of Sichuan&lt;/a&gt;, widely considered as one of the best western-accessible resource on the topic. If you want to know, I cooked &amp;lsquo;Strange Flavour&amp;rsquo; Bang Bang Chicken and Fish-Fragrant Aubergines. (Both will need much improvement&amp;mdash;for example I ended up burning the peanuts while deep-frying them&amp;hellip;&amp;mdash; so if I ever happen to offer to cook you Sichuan food, ask for my only piece of resistance so far, the classic Mapo Tofu.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has a fairly good historical introduction, where a few things caught my eye. Sure, the cuisine of Sichuan is renowned for its variety, and for the ability to combine several ingredients to create distinctive flavour combinations, but at the end of the day many of us will appreciate it for the signature &amp;ldquo;hot-and-numbing&amp;rdquo; taste given by the combination of Sichuan pepper (in the picture below) and abundant serving of chillies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./featured.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, at odd with my intuitive idea of a millennia-old culinary tradition, chillies obviously &amp;ldquo;only reached China in the late sixteenth century [&amp;hellip;] probably brought to China by Portuguese traders&amp;rdquo;. The &lt;em&gt;barbarian peppers&lt;/em&gt; were considered an ornamental plant: &amp;ldquo;it would be at least another century before the use of chillies to flavour food was documented&amp;rdquo;. According to this account, &amp;ldquo;it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796-1820)&amp;rdquo; that the plant was established as a local crop in Sichuan, that is, two centuries ago. Deep-frying, which I associated intimately with Chinese cuisine, seems even more recent in Sichuan: &amp;ldquo;an interest in deep-frying [&amp;hellip;] is said to have come from Americans in 1930s Chongqing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of my previous research about Swedish food. (Yes, when living in Stockholm I had a blog about Swedish food, alas only in Italian, but you can have a look at some popular post, for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucinasvedeseperitaliani.wordpress.com/2010/09/08/surstromming/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cucinasvedeseperitaliani.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/kottbullar/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Many classic recipes of the Swedish traditions were, in fact, the results of a few successful recipe books that appeared after the Second World War and canonised the &lt;em&gt;Husmanskost&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; home-cooked Swedish food. Traditional is in quotation marks not by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is an Italian classic: &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonara&#34;&gt;pasta alla carbonara&lt;/a&gt;. Some even speculate that it was invented to please American soldiers during the liberation of Rome in 1944, by reminding them of their eggs and bacon breakfasts. Whatever this is true or not (it looks too good to be true though), the recipe is never mentioned before the Second World War, suggesting a recent origin. By the way: no onions and no cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe many other examples can be found for &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; dishes. This is of course nothing new. Another of my not-so-secrets is that I had a classic anthropological formation, and, in socio-cultural anthropology, that traditions are often &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Invention_of_Tradition.html?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&amp;amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&#34;&gt;invented&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Imagined_Communities.html?id=nQ9jXXJV-vgC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;imagined&lt;/a&gt; is common currency. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kSukCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=how+traditions+live+and+day&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRkqKZu9DlAhWtTxUIHY53AtkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=how%20traditions%20live%20and%20day&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;How Traditions Live and Die&lt;/a&gt; Olivier Morin makes an analogous point using the example of Highland&amp;rsquo;s clans tartans, that were single-handedly created by a fabric producer in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other traditions may be indeed millennia old. For example, Sara Graça da Silva and Jamie Tehrani used &lt;a href=&#34;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150645&#34;&gt;phylogenetic methods&lt;/a&gt; to analyse the relationships between folktales in Indo-European-speaking societies, and they claim to have found &amp;ldquo;evidence that one tale (‘The Smith and the Devil’) can be traced back to the Bronze Age&amp;rdquo;. The point is: we should be wary of considering traditions as, by-default, ancient and robust (perhaps because of an inborn tendency to copy others). Some may be, and others may be not. I wonder whether cultural evolutionists, beside Morin&amp;rsquo;s book and a less recent, and not very well-known I believe, book from Pascal Boyer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Tradition_as_Truth_and_Communication.html?id=Wuf2PXR1pBgC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;Tradition as Truth and Communication&lt;/a&gt;), have explored in detail the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more general reflection: a backbone of cultural evolution is population thinking, which implies that culture is an emergent, population-level, product of individual interactions, and individual interactions are where the causal magic happens (at least, this is how I read it). From this perspective, it looks natural to think to cultural traditions in a non-essentialist way: they are just the temporary result of individual interactions, looked at on a certain zoom level. However, sometimes &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo; is essentialised and used itself as an explanation, as in &amp;ldquo;we do it &lt;em&gt;because of our culture&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. These kinds of explanations are more and more present when reporting and justifying transcultural experiments (a good criticism of this notion of culture is in &lt;a href=&#34;https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/18/3-4/article-p231_1.xml&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; from Lawrence Hirschfeld). Transcultural experiments are important and necessary, but we need to be cautious when we say that &amp;ldquo;eastern people&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;the Aka&amp;rdquo;, or any other experimental group, behave differently because of &amp;ldquo;culture&amp;rdquo;. It could be, but it could also be that many, interrelated, possibly short-lived, traditions create a specific situation, and it would be interesting to be able to disentangle these possibilities. Anthropologists (in anthropology the WEIRD problem is as a minumum a century-old one: a true tradition!) have recognised this problem, but the solutions proposed have not been, in my opinion, particularly successful, but this may be material for another post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ordeal simulation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_ordeal_simulation/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_ordeal_simulation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the adagio that “man bites dog”, and not “dog bites man”, makes for a good piece of news: unusual, exceptional, events are better stories than everyday occurrences. Hidden behind the surface, however, there is another message that seems so obvious we do not even think about it: both examples are negative events. “Dog wins the lottery” would probably be a good piece of news too, but it is not mentioned. That negative news – and possibly negative narratives in general – are more attractive than positive ones is a bit of a cliché, but it supported by much research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting case-study is false news. By definition, they do not need to describe real facts, so they can exploit our preferences in an almost unconstrained way. In a content analysis of a small sample of articles categorised as online misinformation, I found that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y&#34;&gt;negative articles where around five times more numerous than positive articles&lt;/a&gt;. It is not just about news. English-language fiction became consistently more negative &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2016.1260528&#34;&gt;in the last two centuries&lt;/a&gt;, and English-language song lyrics did the same &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3j6wx/&#34;&gt;in the last fifty years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why, yet, this should be the case? There are many possible explanations: one is that the stories we tell each other are simulations. As much as pilots can exercise their flight skills in dangerous situations safe from risks in a simulator, the pleasure we experience when we enjoy narratives would be rooted in the possibility of exercise our skills in an analogous safe environment. The next time you are in the woods you should be suspicious of the wolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, it makes sense that negative events are predominant in stories: it is worst to arrive unprepared to a negative event than to a positive one. Some &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/9780190666514&#34;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has explored the idea that, in fact, not generally negative events, but threats are what narratives are about. It does not matter &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513817301976&#34;&gt;how realistic the threats are&lt;/a&gt;: you can enjoy watching &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt; even if you do not think ghosts exist or sharing the dubious news about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/morgue-employee-cremated-nap/&#34;&gt;morgue employee cremated while taking a nap&lt;/a&gt; even if you do not usually hang out in morgues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recently published &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0267-0&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, Olivier Morin, Oleg Sobchuk, and I, tried to explore further the threath simulation hypothesis. We found two problems with how the hypothesis is often presented. First, it leaves unspecified which kind of threats should be simulated in narratives. Second, and related, it is not clear whether it is a “theory of fictional content”, i.e. it applies specifically to fictional narratives, or to a more wide range of contents, since, as we saw before, also news tend to bend toward the negative (but also, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11515147&#34;&gt;dreams&lt;/a&gt; have been interpreted in the same way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper, we explore a more exacting version of the hypothesis, that we called the Ordeals simulation hypothesis (mainly Olivier’s brainchild). The hypothesis specifies that neither negative events in general, nor threats in general, should be overrepresented in fiction, but ordeals. Ordeals – the meaning is different from the usage of the term in common language – are threats that are severe, rare, and reactable. ‘Reactable’ here means that we cannot prevent them (as we can do for, say, cardiovascular diseases or pathogen contamination), but they are also not completely out of our control (like being struck by lighting). Aggressions, violent social interactions and, most of all, homicides, are all examples of ordeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./ordeal.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first question is then whether ordeals are overrepresented in fiction with respect to other threats, or, to take a clear case: why do people die in novels? The ordeal simulation hypothesis predicts that agentive or accidental deaths (such as homicides or calamities), but not natural deaths, should be overrepresented. (&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; is too easy of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://deathtimeline.com&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, but I recently read that the currently much talked &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt; series may have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/05/09/the-reason-they-fictionalize-nuclear-disasters-like-chernobyl-is-because-they-kill-so-few-people/#7e6edff641fc&#34;&gt;exaggerated&lt;/a&gt; the number of deaths). We coded hundreds of summaries of novels in wikipedia: mortality rates of novels’ characters are disproportionally high, when compared to realistic estimates. For 100,000 adults in US, between 100 and 200 deaths are estimated every year. But, in novels, we calculated this figure as 19,000, that is, three orders of magnitude higher. The realistic rate for agentive death is only 31 over 100,000, but in novels is more than 13,000. Natural deaths are also overrepresented, but less so: in reality the rate is higher than agentive deaths (107 on 100,000), while in novels is only around 2,000. (Much more in the paper.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question is whether the prominence of agentive deaths is a specific feature of fiction with respect to other kinds of content. To explore this, we used a different methodology: we performed a computer text analysis of two large, comparable, corpora, one of novels and one of private letters and diaries, to detect the frequencies of words related to death in general, and to agentive death (‘kill’, ‘murder’, ‘execution’, etc.) in particular. The ordeal simulation hypothesis would predict that the frequency of agentive death-related words would be higher in the novels than in the private documents, but no difference should be found for general death-related words. In this case, the prediction was not confirmed: mentions of death, both violent and non-violent, were about equally frequent in fictional and non-fictional material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can we conclude from all that? Agentive deaths are overrepresented in fiction, but they are also, so it seems, overrepresented in material written without the intention of being made public. Perhaps the ordeal simulation hypothesis is not on the right track. My opinion, however, is that the problem may lie in finding an explanation that works for, and only for, fictional material. From the psychological point of view, how different is to read a true story, a piece of news, or a novel? (agentive deaths sure are overrepresented in news, see the plot below – full study &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./OUD.png&#34; alt=&#34;png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How different is to write a novel, a diary entry, or a letter? Perhaps there is no specific feature that makes fictions different from other materials, besides, as suggested before when mentioning misinformation, bigger freedom of explore possible contents. Maybe developing a “theory of fiction” (that works only for fiction) is misguided. There are various elements that make narratives (fiction, diaries, news, but also scientific theories, political orientations, etc.) attractive, these elements are the legitimate objects of study, and we can apply them to various domains, fiction included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0267-0&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, and if you are really interested, &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/fjkze/&#34;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; the data and codes for the analysis. The paper was published in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/collections/feibciaebg&#34;&gt;Cultural Evolution&lt;/a&gt; collection of Palgrave Communications, with many other contributions worth looking at.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_morgue/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_morgue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Online misinformation, fake news, false news, hoaxes, you name it, has been blamed for almost everything bad happening in the last years, from the success of Trump to Brexit, from the election of Bolsonaro to the (relative) spread of the anti-vax movement. The scientific consensus on the prominence and on the effect of online misinformation, however, is, at best, mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highly-publicised studies had supported the scaremongers showing, for example, that falsehood spread &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146&#34;&gt;farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth&lt;/a&gt; or that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0132&#34;&gt;‘low-quality’ information is equally likely to go ‘viral’ than ‘hi-quality’ information because of our ‘limited attention’&lt;/a&gt; (notice however that the former study does not compare ‘falsehood’ with ‘truth’, but debunked rumours versus confirmed rumours, so that real news that nobody debunked, i.e. the majority of them, are not even considered, and the latter has been recently retracted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other works, however, had painted a more nuanced image, showing that the production and the consumption of misinformation is &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/374?fbclid=IwAR0ThyrRJk7feelo0SdkBr6obs3NIwjJgZt_E4QCCHYkfAva7Eo8A5A4VlI&#34;&gt;concentrated in a limited portion of social media users&lt;/a&gt;, that individuals that have already extreme political views &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/fake-news-2016.pdf&#34;&gt;are more likely to be exposed to political misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and that, in general, misinformation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.31.2.211&#34;&gt;unlikely to change people minds&lt;/a&gt;. And, simply, other studies have shown that the actual amount of online misinformation &lt;a href=&#34;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaau4586&#34;&gt;is not that big&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the narrative supporting that online misinformation is dangerous is itself very persuasive. It is easier to think that the people that voted Trump (you can replace this with whatever you do not like) have been manipulated by evil figures, and if they would have access to the correct information they would have done the right thing. This narrative is also quite dangerous, I think, because creates an easy scapegoat (you can make up any newspaper article with this schema: “How [name of social media] helped [thing that you do not like]”) that often distract to more relevant social, economic, and cultural problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this narrative does not fit particularly well with an evolutionary account of human behaviour. We are a species that heavily relies on communication, social interactions, and learning from others. While details widely vary, researchers studying cultural evolution and cognition agree that, for the characteristics allowing communication, social interactions, and learning from others to be evolved in the first place, we should not be too &lt;a href=&#34;https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-22175-001&#34;&gt;gullible&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, the conditions could be so different now that we could be more easily tricked, but this is an open question, and, given a ‘presumption of good design’, we should be at least sceptical of answers that are too pessimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this somewhat reassuring perspective, however, online misinformation does exist, and one can ask what the possible advantages of misinformation could be. In a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0224-y&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, I proposed that one of these could simply be that misinformation can be manufactured building on features that make it attractive in an almost unconstrained way, whereas ‘true’ news cannot, simply because they need to correspond to reality. Misinformation can be designed to spread more than real information does (whether this is a conscious process or not). Cognitive anthropologists have put forward features that make some content, everything else equal, more appealing, memorable, or attention-grabbing than other content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example: many misinformation articles (I examine a small sample of ‘fake news’ from 2017: all the material, including the links and the texts used, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/78vhn/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) contains threat-related information, even though threats &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513817301976&#34;&gt;do not need to be relevant for us&lt;/a&gt; (as in the article that gives the title to this blog post: not many of us usually take naps in a morgue. Still, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/&#34;&gt;false news&lt;/a&gt; has been shared/liked/commented more than one million times on Facebook). Other features (negative content, disgust, etc.) and many more details are explained in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misinformation is not low-quality information that succeeds in spreading because of the shortcomings of online communication. Quite the opposite, misinformation, or at least some of it, is high-quality information that spreads because online communication is efficient. The difference is that ‘quality’ is not about truthfulness, but about how it fits with our cognitive predispositions. Online “fake news”, is, from this perspective, not much of a political and propagandistic phenomenon, but is more similar to the diffusion of memes, urban legends, and the like (of course political misinformation exist, even though, interestingly, often takes advantage of similar cognitive preferences to spread, think about the notorious &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory&#34;&gt;Pizzagate&lt;/a&gt;, with its mix of threat, sex, and disgust).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is part of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/collections/feibciaebg&#34;&gt;Cultural evolution&lt;/a&gt; collection, edited by Jamie Tehrani, and I invite you to have a look at the other articles too!&lt;/p&gt;
