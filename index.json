Results from these experiments have been extended to real-life cultural domains, such as online misinformation or urban legends. However, a crucial difference between online transmission and these experiments is that participants in transmission chains need to understand, memorise, and reproduce the content, while an online “share” simply involves the willingness to do it. Does this difference influence which content is successful?\n\n**Methods:** Two fully preregistered online experiments (https://osf.io/wf7pd). The first experiment (N=540) tests whether negative content, threat-related information, and information eliciting disgust are better transmitted than their neutral counterpart in a traditional transmission chain setup. In the second experiment (N=600), the same material is used, but participants are asked whether they would share or not the content in two conditions: in a large anonymous social network, or with their friends, in their favourite social network.\n\n**Results:** Experiment 1 confirmed that attractive content is better transmitted than its neutral counterpart, for all three types of content. Experiment 2 instead showed that, out of six possibilities (2 conditions X 3 contents), in only one the attractive content was shared more than the non-attractive one, i.e. negative content in anonymous sharing.\n\n**Conclusion:** Content biases are stronger when retelling a story than when sharing it.","tags":[],"title":"From storytelling to Facebook.

I never had a good answer, so, together with Marco Smolla, we discussed it would have been interesting to develop some material, in a form of a long tutorial, or a book (at that time, conferences were still in person\u0026hellip;). While doing some research, I quickly found that Alex Mesoudi had already put together some basic R Markdown IBMs with the same goal, so we happily joined forces.\nThe result is Individual-based model of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R. The Introduction quickly explains the whys, whats, and hows of the book, and I would suggest to start from there if you are intersted. Some main points here:\n  The book is intended for people with a basic R knowledge that want to learn cultural evolution IBMs by doing. We cut most of the theoretical complexities of modelling (some references can be found in the Introduction) and focused on reproducing existent models, explaining the code almost line-by-line. In sum, this is not a book you want to read on the couch in front of the fire, but on your desk in front of an RStudio window.\n  We choose to use R (and, with some licence, the tidyverse) not because is the best programming language for IBMs, but because is probably the most diffuse at the moment among researchers in cultural evolution. The idea is that, if one already knows R, the additional cost of learning IBMs is relatively limited, as opposed to starting from scratch with a new programming language. (And, anyway, I am too old to learn Julia.)\n  The book builds in complexity, both from the programming and the conceptual point of view. We start with IBMs versions of the \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; cultural evolution analytical models, assuming that most of the readers will be at least familiar with their verbal descriptions, and we then move to more recent, or less standard, topics. They include Roger\u0026rsquo;s paradox and its solutions, how to model the effects of demography and migrations, social networks, the importance of convergent transformations, etc. A full table of content is here.\n  We tried to be generally consistent with programming style, conventions, etc. (see again the Introduction), but we also use, especially in the later chapters, different programming techniques so that readers can see how things can be done differently. This should expand the programming knowledge - or simply be confusing. Feedback is welcome.\n  Given the code-heavy nature of the book, the best way to use it is from the Bookdown-generated html version, available here, where the code can be easily copied-and-pasted. The R Markdown files that build the book can be find here, if you prefer to work directly on those. There is also a pdf version here but, as said above, the html version is advised. Also, some of the code did not render well in the pdf, so you may need both in any case.\n  Finally, the html version of the book is, and will always be, open access. We have a doi that can be used to cite it, and we are discussing some options to also have a \u0026ldquo;proper\u0026rdquo; publisher for a physical, paper-based, version, but nothing has been planned yet. In fact, if someone has any advice, they are welcome.\n  So: happy modelling, and remember the book is a first complete draft, but still a draft, so we expect to change and improve bits and pieces in a collaborative effort!\n","date":1608681600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608681600,"objectID":"352ce8d51d9b43144505601a2a823658","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_ibm_cultevo/","publishdate":"2020-12-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_ibm_cultevo/","section":"post","summary":"Learn cultural evolution individual-based modelling starting from a basic knowledge of R.","tags":["my research"],"title":"Individual-based models of cultural evolution.

Not only this is not true but, I believe, is also a dangerous narrative that makes us focus on the wrong problems instead of the real ones. Anyway, this is not a topic I can elaborate on here (hey, I wrote a book - partly - about that!).\nBut, of course, some misinformation does spread. Another aspect of these stale criticism is that, naturally, the culprit is social media. Luckily, many real experts of media have long recognised the contribution, or in fact the prominent role, that mainstream, traditional, media have in the current spread of misinformation. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of Reuters Institute at Oxford University, reports on Twitter several examples of mainstream media, or prominent political figures, spreading or originating false or misleading information: Misinformation often comes from the top.\nAs an Italian living in UK, with part of my family living in Italy, I have been irritated by how the major Italian newspaper (for number of readers), La Repubblica, covered the last days of news from UK. But I noticed the disservice before, so hang with me.\nThe 15th of November, La Repubblica - I repeat, the major Italian newspaper - covered the declarations of don Livio Fanzaga, the director of Radio Maria, a large Catholic radio, which, among others, claimed that \u0026ldquo;Coronavirus is a conspiracy under the impulse of Satan\u0026rdquo;, with the goal of \u0026ldquo;building a new world without God\u0026rdquo;. Now, why a major newspaper should report the delusional beliefs of a not very important figure? In addition, in the whole article there is not a single comment from the journalist on the declarations. If I remember correctly, but I can not check now, the article was linked from the first page of the online version (why??) and the declarations were reported as \u0026ldquo;controversial\u0026rdquo;, which is, clearly, not the right word.\nThe 9th of December, in the first days of the successful roll-out of the UK vaccine (our local medical practice texted us yesterday that the first 1,000 people have been vaccinated in our Bristol neighbourhood), La Repubblica reported, as full-page headline of the online version, the news about the two allergic reactions among the early people vaccinated. Now, this is technically not false, but it is an expected consequence of all vaccines. It was quickly reported in other international newspapers (as it should be) and quickly forgotten (as it should be). Putting this news as full-page headline, when we should all strive to understand how to convince \u0026ldquo;hesitant\u0026rdquo; people and reassure everybody about the vaccine, is not only bad journalism, but it could have dangerous consequences.\nWe arrive to Sunday, after the declaration of the stricter Christmas lockdown for some areas in UK, the new strain, and the stop of flights from UK to Italy. It is a worrying situation, so what does the major Italian newspaper do? Again, full-page headline. The summary contains an anonymous quote: \u0026ldquo;We run away. The situation in London is out of control\u0026rdquo;. While health secretary Matt Hancock did say that the new variant (not \u0026ldquo;the situation in London\u0026rdquo;) was out of control, he certainly did not say anything about running away from London, so it is not clear what the quote refers to. But, beside the details, it is clearly made up, explicitly or not, to scare readers (a strategy often used in misinformation).\nWe arrived to the title that today made me writing this post instead of doing something more festive: \u0026ldquo;Chaos in UK, you even have to do the tests by yourself!\u0026quot;. Summary: \u0026ldquo;It is a jungle there, that\u0026rsquo;s why there has been an out-of-control diffusion\u0026rdquo;. The major italian newspaper. A (supposedly) serious, left-leaning, large circulation newspaper.\nI am not a supporter of the current UK government, and I have plenty of criticisms on their Covid management, but: you can choose whether to do the swab yourself or with an assistant (parents always do it for children) and this is because people prefer to do it by themselves instead of having someone else doing it to them. UK tested, from the beginning of October, between 300,000 and 400,000 people every day, which is double of triple of what Italy did. We had a test for our daughter (she had a fever for few days): we booked it online in the evening on the nhs website, we got a slot for the next morning, we did it in 10 minutes and we had the result (negative!) the day after. Hardly chaos.\nIt is difficult to comment on the rest, that is, implying that the \u0026ldquo;out-of-control diffusion\u0026rdquo;, which I guess refers to the new strain, is due to the fact that here is a \u0026ldquo;jungle\u0026rdquo;. Not much to say: mutations can happen anywhere (as they did and do). Not to mentione that one of the reasons why the new mutation has been first found in UK is that UK does on average 56 genomic sequences for every 1,000 covid cases, against, for example, the 0.42 of Italy (data from here: in other words, if the new strain would have been equally present in Italy and UK, everything else being equal, UK would have around 130 times more likelihood to detect it).\n\u0026ndash;\nTo conclude this rant-ish and quickly written post. It is disheartening how this journalism seems to be acceptable. Beside the academic thoughts, it can have important (see the vaccine example above) and real (Hi mum, I am good!) consequences. The fact that it goes together with the \u0026ldquo;social media are the culprit\u0026rdquo; slogan just makes it more unnerving. Anyway: check your news sources, stay safe wherever you are, and enjoy the holidays if you can!\n","date":1608595200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608595200,"objectID":"22a60142ed3309879142a25a1a74533a","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_covid_misinfo/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_covid_misinfo/","section":"post","summary":"How La Repubblica, a major Italian newspaper, spreads misinformation.","tags":["my research","digital age"],"title":"Covid misinformation on mainstream Italian media","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Alex Mesoudi","Marco Smolla"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606953600,"objectID":"f3164d8edddeaf93491561ab7f4675c4","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/preprint_ibmcultevo/","publishdate":"2020-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint_ibmcultevo/","section":"publication","summary":"The field of cultural evolution has emerged in the last few decades as a thriving, interdisciplinary effort to understand cultural change and cultural diversity within an evolutionary framework and using evolutionary tools, concepts and methods. Given its roots in evolutionary biology, much of cultural evolution is grounded in, or inspired by, formal models. Yet many researchers interested in cultural evolution come from backgrounds that lack training in formal models, such as psychology, anthropology or archaeology. The aim of this book is to partly address this gap by showing readers how to create individual-based models (IBMs, also known as agent-based models, or ABMs) of cultural evolution. We provide example code written in the programming language R, which has been widely adopted in the scientific community. We will go from very simple models of the basic processes of cultural evolution, such as biased transmission and cultural mutation, to more advanced topics such as the evolution of social learning, demographic effects, and social network analysis. Where possible we recreate existing models in the literature, so that readers can better understand those existing models, and perhaps even extend them to address questions of their own interest.

Based on this, the military reckoned they needed to add additional protections on these parts. Statisticians suggested instead that protections were needed on the cockpit and on the back of the fuselage - the parts less hit. And they were right! The point is that those aeroplanes were the returning ones: aeroplanes presenting that pattern of damage were actually able to come back succesfully after battle. It was the aiprlanes hit in the other areas that were lost.\nWhether the story is true or not, it is a vivid representation of survivorship bias (as well as this excellent xkcd). Each time someone is giving advice based on how they succeed, it is good to remember that one is generalising from a biased sample. In many fields, in addition, success is partly (or mostly, see again the xkcd comic), based on luck or on reasons that can be hardly linked to the success itself, which is a good moment to mention success in academia. The big professor that was interested in X from school? The brilliant researcher that takes a walk every morning? The 12-papers-a-year postdoc that meditate? The 10 rules for juggling academic job and family? (I swear I am not referring to any real example here. Really.)\nMaybe we need to also consider advice from the unsuccessful cases. Thus, I will start the succumbership bias series with my resignation from the role of coordinator of the Cultural Evolution Society publishing committee. The goal of the publishing committee was to start a society journal. After a couple of years, there has not been any progress.\nA short summary: the 7th June 2013 (more than seven years ago), I wrote on my old blog the post “Journal of Cultural Evolution”, anyone?. The post received a quite positive reaction, and various people thought it was a good idea. In 2014, at the EHBEA conference in Bristol, we had a first meeting to discuss the project, and possibly to start to do something concrete in this direction. Nothing much happened, but in 2017, at the first conference of the Cultural Evolution Society in Jena, we had another meeting about the possibility of the journal, and shortly after, the publishing committee started to ponder various options. Today, the Cultural Evolution Society is having a meeting in which I presented (indirectly) my resignation, and it should be discussed what will be done (if anything) with the journal.\nSo here a few thoughts, quite specifically linked to the journal topic, this time influenced by the succumbership bias!\n  You surely saw these quotes about \u0026ldquo;dreaming big\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;following your dreams\u0026rdquo;, and so on. But from the succumberhsip bias point of view, it may be better to have realistic goals, and not be too ambitious. We wanted an open access, self-published journal, we even discussed whether publishing directly the submissions and having online, voluntary, reviews. We did not want to restrict the scope of the journal to usual scientific articles, but having space for datasets, ethnography, commentaries. We wanted to \u0026ldquo;culturally evolve\u0026rdquo; the publishing system (a usual quote from CT). Perhaps we should have contacted Elsevier with \u0026ldquo;hey, do you want to publish the Journal of Cultural Evolution?\u0026rdquo;\n  All of the members of the publishing committee - including yours truly - were working on this project in the spare time. Given the extent of the project I now think it would have been better to have a small group of people committed, and able to focus almost full time for a short period on it. This is not a criticism of our work (we did what we could!), but maybe something the Cultural Evolution Society can think about for the future?\n  Then there are these quotes about many heads that are better than one, the plurality of opinions. Within the few heads of the publishing committee we had slightly different opinions about a wealth of topics (open science? Diversity and inclusivity? Independence? All of them? Can we? Shall we volunteer for this? No? But where do we find the money?). Not insurmountable, but maybe, just maybe, sometimes may be good to be all in agreement.\n  This mostly relates to me. I am not exactly the best person concerning PR and networking, and I did not have strong links with the headquarters of the society. A better-connected person could have probably done a better job.\n  You know that good things need time and it is important to be patient. If the project is good, one waits and, in the end, it will succeed. Or so says the survivor. Perhaps I should have suspected that, if the project was moving so slowly (remember the first idea was in 2013), something was not right.\n  Related to the above, incentives change with time. In particular, one of the main reason to think about a journal for cultural evolution in 2013 was the absence of other, related, venues of publications. Today we have Nature Human Behaviour, Evolutionary Human Sciences, Evolutionary Perspectives on Imaginative Culture, the \u0026ldquo;Cultural Evolution\u0026rdquo; collection in Palgrave\u0026rsquo;s Humanities and Social Sciences Communications and probably others that I am forgetting (excluding here journals that were already present in 2013 and publishing cultural evolution stuff, such as Cliodynamics, Evolution and Human Behavior, or the Journal of Cognition and Culture among others).\n  In any case, I still hope that a self-published, and possibly innovative, journal of the Cultural Evolution Society will appear (who knows, maybe on this moment the executive committee is turning down my resignation and allocating bazillion dollars for the project). Good luck to them/us and thank you to the people that tried with me to carry this forward!\nps: Of course, the succumbership bias is as bad as the survivorship bias.\npps: Thank you to the people that shared kind words with me and, yes, it is not that bad, but honestly I did hope to be able to create this journal one day\u0026hellip;\n","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601942400,"objectID":"862a1ebbef6ab2f13d188395a2670f8a","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_jce/","publishdate":"2020-10-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_jce/","section":"post","summary":"I recently resigned from my role as coordinator of the Cultural Evolution Society publishing committee.

B-data is a collection of resources for finding and processing online behavioural data (that is the B in the name\u0026hellip;), which may be interesting for people working in psychology and cultural evolution.\nAs explained in the page:\n B-data is a curated collection of resources for working with online behavioural data. In recent years, there has been an enormous growth of freely available datasets. In parallel, computational resources and tools to process and analyse them have become more broadly accessible. Lastly, working on pre-existent data can be an important resource in situations where collecting new data may be problematic, for example, due to contemporary COVID 19-related restrictions.\n  The collection aims to provide not only links to datasets of psychological interest, but a more comprehensive perspective on working with online data, including software, examples of previous researches, or pointers to tools for extracting your data from webpages and social media.

Human culture is cumulative, meaning that it increases in complexity and efficiency from one generation to another, drawing on past innovations. Cumulation, however, differs depending on the specific domain. Two features of cultural systems impact the velocity and the robustness of cumulation: availability, i.e. the number of possible cultural traits one has access to, and fidelity of transmission, i.e. the degree to which cultural traits are preserved during transmission. I will discuss how the diffusion of online digital media increases both availability and fidelity, thus boosting the potential for cultural cumulation, possibly in domains where it was before limited.","tags":[],"title":"Cultural evolution on the web","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"I have been told of NGOs job applications that require to include the candidate\u0026rsquo;s Twitter profile. Even when not that explicit, a curated Twitter account is increasingly important for the academic and academic-adjacent job market, if only for networking. As I am active on Twitter from October 2012, I had the occasion to give some advice on how to start on the social media (for example to my wife!). As it seems they worked, I have been suggested to put them in a blog post, so here it is.\nFirst of all, a few notes. This post is not about the technical basics (how to open an account, how to tweet, how to retweet, etc.), I consider you are good with those, or you can easily find this information somewhere else. Second, it is not about becoming a twitter star with thousands of followers, but about having a decent profile for your career development. The bits of advice are pretty general and they should work for an average user. Of course, there are plenty of exceptions and, to become a Twitter star, what counts is probably being already a star, the actual content you share and, mostly, luck. But, again, this is not our goal. Finally, all this is focused on academic or closely linked profiles, that are the only ones for which I have a bit of experience.\n  Time. It seems many people are worried that they do not have enough time to have a curated Twitter profile. While obviously Twitter is a rabbit hole where one can lose all the time in the world, this is not necessary. Nobody has to be completely updated on what the accounts they follow tweet: this is not only impossible but also useless. For the beginning, an hour a week it is more than sufficient to follow some people, read some tweets and post content. Two sessions of half an hour or less, for example, will be enough.\n  Have a curated profile. Use a picture of yourself where you can be recognised. The short bio is important: avoid the witty sentence and put relevant information and links (if useful). Include a link to your website. Here, as an example, my profile. Again, there are many exceptions, but this works on average.\n  Following and followers. Start by following a few hundred accounts, perhaps have a goal (\u0026ldquo;Following 200 accounts for the end of the month\u0026rdquo;). Follow accounts that are related to your field, big and small names, more than the people that you know. Twitter is not about keeping in contact, but about exchanging information. How can you find them? Search with keywords and follow the advice from Twitter. Here a useful shortcut: when you find a reliable profile in your field, that possibly does not follow too many accounts, go through their \u0026ldquo;following\u0026rdquo; and follow the ones that seem relevant. You also want to acquire followers. This mostly depends on the content that you share (see below), but ideally you want that a reasonable proportion of the account you follow will follow you back. Usually this happens, say around 50% at the beginning. When you will have more followers you will be more twitter-attractive, and the probability of begin followed back will grow. If you really are concerned about the number of followers, follow accounts that have more or less the same number of followers/following, as this probably means that they follow back whoever follows them.\n  When to tweet. In general, the more you tweet, the better. However, time is not infinite, and there are many better things to do in life. Still, you should tweet original content (i.e. not a retweeet) at least one or two times a week. This signals your account is active.\n  What to tweet. Things related to your professional topic. Do not tweet what you think about X - or do not do it often - probably not many care. Share information like links to papers, blogs, pieces of news, etc. and, in case, what you think about that.\n  Stick to one topic. The most important - I think - advice about content: be consistent. Do not tweet once about your scientific field, then about your cat, then about your favourite Sichuan dish, then the anti-Trump rant. People will follow and support you (with likes and retweets) if you provide a consistent and up-to-date information about one topic: \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s one of the accounts to follow if you are interested in X\u0026rdquo; (where X is \u0026ldquo;anthropology\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;conservation\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;history of Middle East\u0026rdquo; or whatever). If I follow you because I am interested in conservation, I probably do not care about what you ate last night (there are other social media for this). One out-of-topic tweet from time to time is ok, but not too many. Of course you can have two related topics (say, ehm, \u0026ldquo;cultural evolution\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;digital media\u0026rdquo;) Two unrelated topics? Not sure. Each time I want to tweet something unrelated to my research, for example politics, I refrain, and I think it is good.\n  How to find relevant content. This is the difficult part, here is what works for me. A good source of new scientific articles are Google Scholar alerts (of course you have a Google Scholar profile). They generally fit very well with your research, so you should be on the safe side. Another source is, of course, Twitter itself (for me it has replaced almost all the official journals\u0026rsquo; alerts): retweet relevant material from others (see also below for the \u0026ldquo;Retweet with comment\u0026rdquo;). A good way to provide new content even with retweets is to retweet material from more obscure accounts, or accounts unrelated to your field. Retweeting the last paper of the star researcher with 50,000 followers will not provide new content to your followers, but retweeting the interesting paper of a less known researcher, or showing how something in another field is related to yours will. News, conferences, open positions related to your field are also good content. At the end of the day, however, this will be about what you read and what you find interesting, so: be curious.\n  Check the content. Read before sharing is the basic advice. But, really, do it. You do not have to read a full scientific article before you tweet it, but you want to be sure that it is about what is supposed to be and that, for example, the link points to the correct place, etc.\n  Personalise the content. The other advantage of reading before sharing is that you can personalise the tweet, and this is added value. You can quickly say why the article, or the piece of news, is interesting or criticizable, this is better than just tweeting the title (but this is also ok). This is especially useful for reteweets: you can \u0026ldquo;Retweet with comment\u0026rdquo; so that, again, you add some personal information, but also, the tweet is associated in the timeline to your profile, so it is your tweet.\n  Photos and videos. They do make tweets more attractive. If you tweet an article you may want to include one of the plots, or some related image. This is why I put in each blog post a picture, even if not very related (including this one): when sharing it on Twitter, the small picture appears together with the link.\n  Hashtags. I do not use them, but it does seem they increase the number of likes and retweets (which in turn will ultimately increase the number of your followers) so I guess a moderate use (one, maximum two) in some of the tweets, when they are relevant, may be a good strategy.\n  Like. There are various reasons to like relevant tweets from other users. They will know about you, you can use them as bookmarks, and you possibly train the algorithm that select which tweets you will see more prominently. Also like all replies to your tweets, if they are not offensive, and if they are at least related, because why not.\n  Be nice. In eight years of Twitter, I believe I got involved in quarrels two or three times. Of course, I think it was not my fault, but that is too easy. In any case, there is nothing to gain. Twitter is not the place for long and nuanced discussions. This is fine, as long as one is aware of it. I found Twitter tremendously useful for sharing and discovering interesting stuff and for many good conversations and, so far, the balance useful/annoying has been largely positive.\n  ","date":1593475200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593475200,"objectID":"c712f530b545019ae794c4d5c3ca36de","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_twitter/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_twitter/","section":"post","summary":"Academic and academic-adjacent jobs increasingly require having a Twitter account.

There are many things to appreciate in the review. First - but I may be biased here\u0026hellip; - it is a positive one. Andrew concludes by writing:\n Both Mercier and Acerbi\u0026rsquo;s volumes are enjoyable, story-driven journeys. They guide the reader through large and expanding literatures in an entertaining and illuminating way. They are upbeat about human capabilities and provide a useful optimistic counterpoint to the recent spate of epistemological doomsayer.\n I could not have said it better.\nSecond, it is pleasing to be in good company. Not born yesterday is an excellent book. In fact, while writing, my own views about how social information is evaluated have somehow glided from a more standard cultural evolution framework to the epistemic (or \u0026ldquo;open\u0026rdquo;) vigilance perspective presented in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s volume. If I would start working on Cultural evolution in the digital age today it would probably be a quite different book.\nThird, and last, the \u0026ldquo;concerns\u0026rdquo; are also perceptive. One of those is that Cultural evolution in the digital age did not discuss enough the importance of the integration between the literature on social network models and the largely individual-level perspective endorsed in the book. I completely agree. The main theoretical perspectives I drew upon are indeed not particularly sensitive to the topic. Evolutionary psychology theories are mostly theories about individual minds, and while social interactions and communications are certainly important for these theories, they are important with respect to how they shaped those individual minds. (Incidentally, I always thought the evolutionary psychology is one of the approaches that would have more to gain by adopting a modelling perspective, but only very few evolutionary psychology works use it.) Cultural evolution seems more receptive: virtually all theories in cultural evolution take into account population-level dynamics, still populations are generally considered as uniform or - I think - fully-connected networks, i.e. networks were all individuals have the same probability to interact with any other individual in the network.\nOf course, there are exceptions. At least a few papers adopt an explicit \u0026ldquo;cultural evolution on networks\u0026rdquo; perspective and there is an enormous grey area (the \u0026ldquo;grey\u0026rdquo; is just because I am not familiar myself) of works that are relevant from both perspectives. In my folder \u0026ldquo;archive/projects_discussed/interesting_to_do/ok_lets_see/but_probably_not\u0026rdquo; there is an old modelling project aimed at comparing the diffusion of cultural traits under different selective biases (neutral, model-based, frequency-based, and content-based) in different population structures: fully-connected (the control condition, standard in cultural evolution), Erdos-Reyni random networks and Scale-free networks. As the name of the folder suggests, the project is still there.\nAs a matter of fact, one of the reasons that motivated me working on Cultural evolution in the digital age was exactly the lack of integration between the two literatures. However, my unsatisfaction was going in the opposite direction. Research on online cultural dynamics was (and still is) dominated by the network/complexity science perspective. Whereas these works are computationally sophisticated, and some of them are illuminating, I have been sometimes frustrated by the lack (if not, worst, the implausibility) of the assumptions about individual psychology. My feeling is that many questionable ideas circulating about the negative effects of digital online media, e.g. the overestimation of \u0026ldquo;echo chambers\u0026rdquo; effects or of the influence of bots and misinformation, may have found support in the scientific literature because of this problem.\nUnfortunately, I have been not explicit about that in the book and, as Andrew\u0026rsquo;s review rightly criticises, not particularly constructive, but the hope (implausible, I admit) was that researchers from the network/complexity science perspective would integrate some of the ideas in their models. But perhaps it is up to us. Interdisciplinarity is hard.\n","date":1590451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590451200,"objectID":"bb7e00dbdd0712481097caa4efaf169b","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_cultural_evolution_networks/","publishdate":"2020-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_cultural_evolution_networks/","section":"post","summary":"Cultural evolution models should integrate network models - and viceversa.","tags":["big questions","my research"],"title":"Cultural evolution and networks","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"In a recent paper with Lotty Brand and Alex Mesoudi, we documented how the lyrics of popular songs have become sadder in the last few decades. The proportion of words with positive emotional content has decreased and, on the contrary, the proportion of words with negative emotional content has increased, on average, from the 1960s to now. (If you are a reader of this blog you probably already know about all that - if not, see this aeon piece for more about the research).\nSeveral people have suggested that this could be mainly due to the fact that new - sadder or angrier - genres (for example hip-hop) have replaced the genres dominant fifty years ago. This is a sensible hypothesis. In one of the two datasets we used for the main analysis (indicated in the paper as \u0026ldquo;mxm\u0026rdquo; dataset), derived from the lyrics in the website musixmatch.com, songs are also tagged with their genre, so it was relatively straightforward to explore the contribution of each genre to the general trend. The R code and the outputs are available in a GitHub repository.\nFirst of all, here the general trends for the \u0026ldquo;mxm\u0026rdquo; dataset. (If you are interested, we explain in the aeon piece linked above what the facts that these numbers are small and that the proportion of negative emotion-words is anyway always lower than the proportion of positive emotion-words mean for the importance of the trends.)\nGoing to the genre analysis, there are 168 possible genre tags in the dataset, on a total of 159,015 songs, but the most common 20 genres account for 99% of all songs.\nThere are clear difference in the emotional tone of lyrics in different genres, and they correspond to the general intuition: among the sad genres there are indeed recently emerged ones, such as \u0026ldquo;Heavy Metal\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Punk\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Hip Hop/Rap\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Indie Rock\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Alternative\u0026rdquo;. (\u0026ldquo;Holiday\u0026rdquo;, the more positive and less negative genre, is basically the Spotify Christmas playlist of your dreams - or nightmares perhaps.)\nWe can also look at the prevalence of genres through years. Genres like \u0026ldquo;Alternative\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Heavy Metal\u0026rdquo; did indeed grew in popularity, whereas they were completely absent in the 1960s. On the contrary, positively-connotated genres like \u0026ldquo;R\u0026amp;B/Soul\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Christian \u0026amp; Gospel\u0026rdquo; show a strong decrease. Notice \u0026ldquo;Hip Hop/Rap\u0026rdquo; does not appear as growing too much in this dataset, which implies that is not the cause of the increase of negative emotion in lyrics (in this dataset).\nThis suggests that there is some truth in the idea that the overall increase in sadness is due to the emergence of new, sadder, genres. Genres like \u0026ldquo;Alternative\u0026rdquo;, for example, did not show any trend, but their \u0026ldquo;baseline\u0026rdquo;, so to speak, corresponds well to the current levels of negative/positive emotions overall.\n\u0026ldquo;Heavy Metal\u0026rdquo;, consistently with the stereotype, is indeed, on average, a sad genre - as I said on Twitter, \u0026ldquo;unsurprising sentiment analysis results are good sentiment analysis results\u0026rdquo;. In fact, in 2010, the proportion of words expressing negative emotions was higher than the proportion of words expressing positive emotions, going beyond the overall results (and showing that the Polyanna principle does not hold everywhere\u0026hellip;).\nHowever, we can see that also \u0026ldquo;Rock\u0026rdquo; and Pop\u0026rdquo;, the two most popular genres in the 1960s and still accounting for more than 30% of the total number of songs in 2010, show clear trends going in the overall direction.\nThis suggests that the overall trend is not only imputable to the introduction of new genres, but that also \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; genres have become sadder. In the same GitHub repository, you can find the correspondent plots for all the 20 genres analysed.\n","date":1589068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589068800,"objectID":"6f169963feb0960d3a141138ff4c0ef9","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_mxm_genres/","publishdate":"2020-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_mxm_genres/","section":"post","summary":"Pop song lyrics became sadder in the last fifty years. Is it because sadder genres become more popular?","tags":["pop culture","my research"],"title":"Sentiment analysis of song lyrics by genre","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"I have recently published, together with Lotty Brand and Alex Mesoudi, a paper studying the expression of emotions in the lyrics of the last 50 years of English-language pop songs - open access here. We try to explain two related empirical findings: the frequency of words with positive emotional content decreases and, on the contrary, the frequency of words with negative emotional content increases in song lyrics. (Both by roughly one third. If, for example, the average song in 1960s had 30 words associated with negative emotion, the average song in 2010s has 40, assuming that they have the same total number of words.) This is a specific aspect of a relatively well-known phenomenon, that has been measured in various ways: pop songs have become sadder in the last decades.\nWhat we added in the paper is an attempt of explaining why this happened. We looked for cultural influences, such as upcoming artists copying the emotional tone from successful, or prestigious, artists of the previous years, but we did not find they were able to explain the pattern. We found, instead, that a general preference for songs with more negative lyrics, coupled with \u0026ldquo;unbiased transmission\u0026rdquo;, i.e. upcoming artists copying at random from the artists of the previous years, could explain it. Of course, upcoming artists do not \u0026ldquo;copy at random\u0026rdquo;: unbiased transmission stands for many unknown processes that cumulatively appear similar to genetic drift, where songs tend to \u0026ldquo;inherit\u0026rdquo; from one year to the other some of their features. The effect of unbiased transmission is important in our statistical model, but unbiased transmission is non-directional, so that a preference for negative lyrics, even if weak, can drive the process. We also wrote a popular piece about it in aeon, where we explain more in detail all that.\nAn interesting question for me is then why, if there is a general preference for negative lyrics, we observe a trend toward sadder songs or, in other words, why songs in the 1960s, at the beginning of our datasets, were happier? There are many possible answers here: one, that I thought possible, was that in the middle of last century songs were artificially, so to say, happier, possibly because of more control from centralised broadcasting networks, producers, and similar. It could have been possible that, if few people in the key positions wanted to push happier songs, they could succeed. Or at least, their work would have been easier than now, when we have access to more options, from private radio to recorded tape cassettes to, obviously, Spotify and co. In sum, access to more options allows people to listen to the music they really want to.\nHow to test this idea? An immediate prediction is that older songs should be sadder than middle-of-last-century songs. After some searches, and a chat with Pat Savage, I found the Child Ballads, a collection of 305 traditional ballads, put together in the 19th century. The datation of the ballads is problematic (even though most of them are probably from the 19th century), but the collection fits well in a not-very rigorous, but useful, category of \u0026ldquo;older\u0026rdquo; songs. I extracted the texts from here and performed the same sentiment analysis I have made for the recent pop songs. An obvious problem is that the sentiment analysis (LIWC, dictionary-based) uses a contemporary lexicon, which may not be suitable for the analysis of old lyrics. A shortcut I used for this (very) exploratory analysis is to also check how many of the words in each songs were recognised by a contemporary English dictionary and to use this figure to calculate the proportion of positive- and negative-emotion words. All the code is available in a GitHub repository. It looks my hypothesis was wrong. The proportion of words associated to emotions, both positive and negative, is more similar to the 1960s figure than to the contemporary one. In sum, old ballads are happier than contemporary pop songs, and in line with pop songs of fifty years ago. (In the plot below, \u0026ldquo;Billboard\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mxm\u0026rdquo; are the two datasets we used to assess the sentiment of the last fifty years songs. More information in the paper or in the aeon piece.)\nOf course, this is a very basic, and hardly rigorous, analysis. In my intuition old ballads are not exactly cheerful and breezy. Still, apparently, they are, at least when compared to contemporary pop lyrics. What to do with these results, I do not know. Are there more rigorous assessments of sentiment for old song lyrics around? Are Child ballads representative? Other ideas that can explain the contemporary trends?

It is currently debated which cognitive abilities support cumulative culture, but behavior copying is one of the main abilities proposed. One important source of contention is the presence or absence of behavior copying in our closest living relatives, non-human great apes (apes) - especially given that their behavior does not show clear signs of cumulation. Those who claim that apes copy behavior often base this claim on the existence of stable ape cultures in the wild (Whiten et al. 1999; van Schaik et al. 2003). We developed an individual-based model to test whether ape cultural patterns can both emerge and stabilize in the entire absence of any behavior copying, but only allowing for a well-supported alternative social learning mechanism, namely socially-mediated reinnovation, where only the frequency of reinnovation is under social influence, but the form of the behavior is not. Our model reflects wild ape life conditions, including physiological and behavioral individual needs, demographic and spatial features, and the possible range of genetic and ecological variations between populations. Our results show that, under a wide range of realistic values of all model parameters, we fully reproduce the most defining features of wild ape cultural patterns (Whiten et al. 1999; van Schaik et al. 2003). Overall, our results show that ape cultures can both emerge and stabilize without behavior copying.

I will discuss more in detail how the spread of online misinformation can be seen from this perspective, focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive biases. Misinformation, being less constrained by reality than true information, can be manufactured (consciously or not) to appeal to these cognitive biases. As such, online misinformation can be characterised not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency. The difference is that 'quality' does not denote truthfulness but psychological appeal.","tags":[],"title":"Digital age: the long view","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581033600,"objectID":"ba75d6efcbe793dd61e6fb9f3cb458be","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/the_times_sad_songs/","publishdate":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/the_times_sad_songs/","section":"media","summary":"The Times covers our research on cultural evolution of emotions in song lyrics.","tags":["Recent"],"title":"Heaven knows pop’s miserable now","type":"media"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1581033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581033600,"objectID":"8e97420164284b98620ee0b9e8b30d0c","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/lepoint_book/","publishdate":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/lepoint_book/","section":"media","summary":"An excellent review (in french) of Cultural Evolution in the Digital Age.","tags":["Recent"],"title":"Tout ce que vous pensiez savoir d'Internet est (sans doute) faux","type":"media"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"0419ccaa7752cd4f4f0af6441e95b893","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/aeon_emotions/","publishdate":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/aeon_emotions/","section":"media","summary":"A piece for Aeon on our research on the cultural evolution of emotion in pop song lyrics.","tags":["Recent"],"title":"Why are pop songs getting sadder than they used to be?","type":"media"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Daphne Kerhoas","Amanda Webber","Grainne McCabe","Russell Mittermeier","Christoph Schwitzer"],"categories":null,"content":"   ","date":1579219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579219200,"objectID":"1fca50dc8ee9dfc5ca9c14c13ddb9a82","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2020_jnc/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_jnc/","section":"publication","summary":"Assessing the impact of conservation campaigns is of high importance for optimizing the use of limited resources. Lists of threatened species are often used as media outreach tools, but their usefulness is rarely tested.

We analyzed a database of 40 million articles from major scientific publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Nature, Plos, Pubmed, Biomed Central) finding an increase in the number of papers mentioning a species after its inclusion in the list. We also analyzed media penetration (data from Google News), and online interest (data from Google Blogs, Twitter, and Google Trends), collecting daily data for one month before and one after the official launch of the 2014-2016 list (24th November 2015). The results show a short spike of interest on Google News and Twitter but no long term effect, indicating a limited effect on the general public.

Writing down these few musings is mostly useful for me, but perhaps they can be interesting for the people that already know the diatribe - the post is hardly a crowd-pleaser.\nFirst, my general position is more or less stable on what I wrote five (!) years ago together with Alex Mesoudi (here, even if I have a different opinion on many specific points) and, more recently, in the first half of the \u0026ldquo;Transmitting and sharing\u0026rdquo; chapter of my book. The points carried forward by cultural attraction theory are valuable and overlooked in much cultural evolution research, so it is important to pay attention to them. Convergent transformation can, as much as faithful copying, bring about cultural stability. Explaining the diffusion of a trait with culture - a tendency to copy others faithfully - is to assume what requires itself an explanation. We copy the majority, the successful, the elders: until we do not. Individual and social learning are not two different processes, and, yes, I now think that culture \u0026ldquo;is a property, not a thing\u0026rdquo;.\nOn the other side, hi-fi copying is important in some domains, and there is a limit to what convergent transformations can achieve. Cultural transmission does allow for the diffusion of new information that can not be reconstructed. Cultural attraction people are correct, technically, when they say that high-fidelity transmission is a special case of attraction, with reconstruction equal to zero, or something analogous. However, I believe that the advantages linked to the generality of a theory depend on what we are trying to explain.\nMy position is annoying as I guess I end up to slightly irritating both camps, but, despite what you heard on Twitter, academics are (mostly) a bunch of nice people, and I tend to be able to work with both the factions.\nSecond, I became more and more convinced that the main reason for the disagreement resides in the fact that different people ask different \u0026ldquo;deep\u0026rdquo; questions about culture. Thom Scott-Phillips says something similar here (at the end of section 2). Many cultural evolutionists are interested to explain what is so special in humans, and the answer is, correctly: culture, as they define it. Many cultural attractionists (?), instead, are interested to explain why some cultural traits are succesfull, given the state of the world and of its inhabitants. Again, I tend to share the latter interest but, of course, both questions are legitimate.\nA similar way to put it is that many cultural attractionists are humanists (as in researchers working in the humanities) or social scientists that become frustrated with non-scientific explanations of culture, and pushed interdisciplinarity towards hard sciences. Many cultural evolutionists are instead natural scientists that \u0026ldquo;discovered\u0026rdquo; that culture is important to explain human and, up to a point, non-human behaviour, and pushed interdisciplinarity the other way around. This does not need to be literally true - people actually following the exact career path - but it seems to me it catches an interesting difference.\nThird, and perhaps most controversial, cultural attraction theory stresses (recently with more emphasis) that factors of attraction are multifaceted and, in particular, not only cognitive. Again, for the internal consistency of the theory, this is perfectly right. Personally, I met cultural attraction theory (which was called, at the time, \u0026ldquo;epidemiology of representations\u0026rdquo;) reading Dan Sperber\u0026rsquo;s Explaining Culture, and this changed my scientific life (and, as a consequence, if I look at it from today\u0026rsquo;s perspective, my life tout-court). While the book is the classic source for the \u0026ldquo;factors of attraction can be psychological and ecological\u0026rdquo; motto, it is also home of chapters on culture and mental (massive) modularity, anthropology and psychology, etc. For me, at least, there was a clear message that pan-human cognitive similarities constrain the forms that cultures can take, and contribute to explaining them.\nIndependently on how these cognitive similarities are implemented and on how they arise, I still believe that cultural attraction theory is more interesting if this message is true, and I would not shy away from that. For reconstruction and convergent transformation to provide satisfying explanations, they should be reconducted to a coherent something else, whatever this will be. Of course, the importance of these constraints is variable and domain-dependent, so that in some cases we should prefer reconstruction-based explanations, and in others preservative-transmission-based explanations, but that is, I believe, a stimulating empirical problem for cultural evolutionists.\n","date":1578614400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578614400,"objectID":"14ef19df763b392e536afc2a16ce43b3","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_cultural_attraction/","publishdate":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_cultural_attraction/","section":"post","summary":"Back to an old darling of the blog.","tags":["big questions","my research"],"title":"A few thoughts on cultural attraction","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576594800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576594800,"objectID":"4e2b697ae9009a310bba09244edf79e3","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2019_stockholm/","publishdate":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_stockholm/","section":"talk","summary":"In recent years, researchers from many disciplines have included the concept of culture among their explicatory tools.

Understanding the consequences of the massive diffusion of digital media is of the utmost importance, both from the intellectual and the social point of view. 'Cultural Evolution in the Digital Age' proposes that a specific discipline - cultural evolution - provides an excellent framework to analyse our digital age. Cultural evolution is a vibrant, interdisciplinary, and increasingly productive scientific framework that aims to provide a naturalistic and quantitative explanation of culture. In the book the author shows how cultural evolution offers both a sophisticated view of human behaviour, grounded in cognitive science and evolutionary theory, and a strong quantitative and experimental methodology. The book examines in depth various topics that directly originate from the application of cultural evolution research to digital media. Is online social influence radically different from previous forms of social influence? Do digital media amplify the effects of popularity and celebrity influence? What are the psychological forces that favour the spread of online misinformation? What are the effects of the hyper-availability of information online on cultural cumulation? The cultural evolutionary perspective provides novel insights, and a relatively encouraging take on the overall effects of our online activities on our culture. Cultural Evolution is an area of rapidly growing interest, and this timely book will be important reading for students and researchers in the fields of psychology, anthropology, cognitive science, and the media.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","misinformation","digital media","transmission biases"],"title":"Cultural evolution in the digital age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Brand","Alberto Acerbi","Alex Mesoudi"],"categories":null,"content":" Together with Lotty Brand, we wrote a piece for aeon about the paper: Why are pop songs getting sadder than they used to be?\nThe piece was then widely covered by popular and scientific media, including for example The Times (UK), De Standaard (Belgium), or Dagbaldet Information (Danemark)\n  ","date":1573084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573084800,"objectID":"477085b0b3cb57a7905b5d3bfa1de4c9","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_ehs/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_ehs/","section":"publication","summary":"Popular music offers a rich source of data that provides insights into long-term cultural evolutionary dynamics. One major trend in popular music, as well as other cultural products such as literary fiction, is an increase over time in negatively valenced emotional content, and a decrease in positively valenced emotional content. Here we use two large datasets containing lyrics from n=4,913 and n=159,015 pop songs respectively and spanning 1965-2015, to test whether cultural transmission biases derived from the cultural evolution literature can explain this trend towards emotional negativity. We find some evidence of content bias (negative lyrics do better in the charts), prestige bias (best-selling artists are copied) and success bias (best-selling songs are copied) in the proliferation of negative lyrics. However, the effects of prestige and success bias largely disappear when unbiased transmission is included in the models, which assumes that the occurrence of negative lyrics is predicted by their past frequency. We conclude that the proliferation of negative song lyrics may be explained partly by content bias, and partly by undirected, unbiased cultural transmission.","tags":["cultural evolution","text mining","emotions","transmission biases"],"title":"Cultural evolution of emotional expression in 50 years of song lyrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"One of my secret passion (or not-so-secret, if you know me a bit) is cooking. Last weekend was devoted to the new edition of Fuchsia Dunlop\u0026rsquo;s The Food of Sichuan, widely considered as one of the best western-accessible resource on the topic. If you want to know, I cooked \u0026lsquo;Strange Flavour\u0026rsquo; Bang Bang Chicken and Fish-Fragrant Aubergines. (Both will need much improvement\u0026mdash;for example I ended up burning the peanuts while deep-frying them\u0026hellip;\u0026mdash; so if I ever happen to offer to cook you Sichuan food, ask for my only piece of resistance so far, the classic Mapo Tofu.)\nThe book has a fairly good historical introduction, where a few things caught my eye. Sure, the cuisine of Sichuan is renowned for its variety, and for the ability to combine several ingredients to create distinctive flavour combinations, but at the end of the day many of us will appreciate it for the signature \u0026ldquo;hot-and-numbing\u0026rdquo; taste given by the combination of Sichuan pepper (in the picture below) and abundant serving of chillies.\nHowever, at odd with my intuitive idea of a millennia-old culinary tradition, chillies obviously \u0026ldquo;only reached China in the late sixteenth century [\u0026hellip;] probably brought to China by Portuguese traders\u0026rdquo;. The barbarian peppers were considered an ornamental plant: \u0026ldquo;it would be at least another century before the use of chillies to flavour food was documented\u0026rdquo;. According to this account, \u0026ldquo;it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796-1820)\u0026rdquo; that the plant was established as a local crop in Sichuan, that is, two centuries ago. Deep-frying, which I associated intimately with Chinese cuisine, seems even more recent in Sichuan: \u0026ldquo;an interest in deep-frying [\u0026hellip;] is said to have come from Americans in 1930s Chongqing.\u0026rdquo;\nThis reminded me of my previous research about Swedish food. (Yes, when living in Stockholm I had a blog about Swedish food, alas only in Italian, but you can have a look at some popular post, for example here or here.) Many classic recipes of the Swedish traditions were, in fact, the results of a few successful recipe books that appeared after the Second World War and canonised the Husmanskost, i.e. the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; home-cooked Swedish food. Traditional is in quotation marks not by chance.\nAnother example is an Italian classic: pasta alla carbonara. Some even speculate that it was invented to please American soldiers during the liberation of Rome in 1944, by reminding them of their eggs and bacon breakfasts. Whatever this is true or not (it looks too good to be true though), the recipe is never mentioned before the Second World War, suggesting a recent origin. By the way: no onions and no cream.\nI believe many other examples can be found for \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;classic\u0026rdquo; dishes. This is of course nothing new. Another of my not-so-secrets is that I had a classic anthropological formation, and, in socio-cultural anthropology, that traditions are often invented or imagined is common currency. In How Traditions Live and Die Olivier Morin makes an analogous point using the example of Highland\u0026rsquo;s clans tartans, that were single-handedly created by a fabric producer in the 19th century.\nOther traditions may be indeed millennia old. For example, Sara Graça da Silva and Jamie Tehrani used phylogenetic methods to analyse the relationships between folktales in Indo-European-speaking societies, and they claim to have found \u0026ldquo;evidence that one tale (‘The Smith and the Devil’) can be traced back to the Bronze Age\u0026rdquo;. The point is: we should be wary of considering traditions as, by-default, ancient and robust (perhaps because of an inborn tendency to copy others). Some may be, and others may be not. I wonder whether cultural evolutionists, beside Morin\u0026rsquo;s book and a less recent, and not very well-known I believe, book from Pascal Boyer (Tradition as Truth and Communication), have explored in detail the topic.\nA more general reflection: a backbone of cultural evolution is population thinking, which implies that culture is an emergent, population-level, product of individual interactions, and individual interactions are where the causal magic happens (at least, this is how I read it). From this perspective, it looks natural to think to cultural traditions in a non-essentialist way: they are just the temporary result of individual interactions, looked at on a certain zoom level. However, sometimes \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo; is essentialised and used itself as an explanation, as in \u0026ldquo;we do it because of our culture\u0026quot;. These kinds of explanations are more and more present when reporting and justifying transcultural experiments (a good criticism of this notion of culture is in this paper from Lawrence Hirschfeld). Transcultural experiments are important and necessary, but we need to be cautious when we say that \u0026ldquo;eastern people\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;the Aka\u0026rdquo;, or any other experimental group, behave differently because of \u0026ldquo;culture\u0026rdquo;. It could be, but it could also be that many, interrelated, possibly short-lived, traditions create a specific situation, and it would be interesting to be able to disentangle these possibilities. Anthropologists (in anthropology the WEIRD problem is as a minumum a century-old one: a true tradition!) have recognised this problem, but the solutions proposed have not been, in my opinion, particularly successful, but this may be material for another post.\n","date":1572825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572825600,"objectID":"370a2a39d82755f4a4e75e99bfb4871e","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_sichuan/","publishdate":"2019-11-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_sichuan/","section":"post","summary":"Seemingly millennia-old culinary traditions are relatively young.

If you are lucky, you may have access to a cluster, or a remote computer, where you can run your script. All sorted. Sometimes - as it happens to me now, running this individual-based model - you do not have this option. However, I just found out that launching your RStudio script on Amazon Web Service (AWS) is quite easy (and it is free).\nAs the information needed is scattered on the web, I put together a short tutorial. If you do not trust me, most material comes from here, but it is not explained step-by-step, some information are possibly not relevant for a non-expert (as myself) and, mostly, the AWS interface has been changed from when the page was written. So, follow this short instructions, and you can close your laptop and have your script running for you somewhere else!\nStep-by-step tutorial (1) Create an AWS account First of all, we need an AWS account. Amazon Web Service \u0026ldquo;provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis\u0026rdquo;. However, some products - including the one we will use - are free. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to the AWS webpage and create the account. It asks us some personal data, including the address and, annoyingly, a credit card number, in case we use products that are not free, or exceed the usage limits. (In any case, Amazon probably already knows our credit card number.)\n(2) Launch the AMI Now we want to run our script in the Amazon cloud. Ideally, we would like to run it on a (virtual) computer with RStudio installed. Luckily, someone already did this. Go to this webpage and choose one of the AMI on the right of the page, according to the geographic location (in my case: EU West, London).\nHere is the Wikipedia page about AMI (Amazon Machine Image) if you want to know more, but you do not need to.\n(3) Choose the instance Now we landed on the AWS page of the AMI we choose. The \u0026ldquo;Free Tier\u0026rdquo; instance is already selected, so we do not have to do anything.\n(4) Configure the security To access to Rstudio in the cloud with our browser we need to configure the security in the right way. Thus, before launching the instance, we need to go on the tab 6 (\u0026ldquo;Configure Security Group\u0026rdquo;), and select \u0026ldquo;HTTP\u0026rdquo; from the drop-down menu.\n(5) Review and launch We click on \u0026ldquo;Review and Launch\u0026rdquo; and we land on this page. Check that the \u0026ldquo;AMI details\u0026rdquo; are correct and then click \u0026ldquo;Launch\u0026rdquo;.\n(6) Select the key pair Before launching the instance, we are asked to select a key pair. From the drop-down menu we choose \u0026ldquo;Proceed without a key pair\u0026rdquo;, and check the box below. Now we can click \u0026ldquo;Launch Instances\u0026rdquo;.\n(7) The instance is launched! All good. Click on the ID of the instance (it will be different from the one shown here), to access it.\n(8) Connecting to RStudio Here is the console of our instance. After some time, the \u0026ldquo;Instance State\u0026rdquo; will be on \u0026ldquo;running\u0026rdquo;. We need to copy the Public DNS, and paste it in the address bar of another page our browser to access our instance of RStudio.\n(9) Starting RStudio After a while this page should appear (if not, we need to wait a bit an retry, it may need a few minutes). The username is \u0026ldquo;rstudio\u0026rdquo;, and the password is our \u0026ldquo;Instance ID\u0026rdquo; (see the previous screenshot, on the left side of the Public DNS).\n(10) Virtual RStudio If all went well, we should see the familiar screen below. There is a Welcome.R script. There are two things we should do (which are well explained in the script). First, it is advisable to change our password, from the \u0026ldquo;Instance ID\u0026rdquo; to something else of our choice. To do this, we first load the package included (library(\u0026quot;RStudioAMI\u0026quot;)), and use the function passwd(), which asks for old and new password. The second thing is that we can link our Dropbox so that we can load directly our script, using the function linkDropbox().\n(11) Authorising Dropbox After few seconds, a message on the RStudio console (\u0026ldquo;Please visit the following URL in your browser now to link the server to your Dropbox account:\u0026quot;) will prompt us to authorise the cloud computer to connect to our Dropbox, landing on this page. We need to click on \u0026ldquo;Connect\u0026rdquo;. (We will also receive a mail from Dropbox asking to confirm.)\n(12) Excluding folders from Dropbox sync At this point, a \u0026ldquo;Dropbox\u0026rdquo; folder appears in the \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; tab of RStudio. We do not want to sync all our Dropbox folder in the cloud. When our Dropbox folders start to appear in RStudio, we can use the function excludeSyncDropbox(\u0026quot;*\u0026quot;) to exclude all files to be synced.\n(13) Syncing what we need Imagine the script we need to run is called scriptThatRunsForHours.R. A good idea is to create a folder in our dropbox - let\u0026rsquo;s call it \u0026ldquo;AWS_RStudio\u0026rdquo; and put the script in that folder. Now we can ask to synchronise only this folder, using the function includeSyncDropbox(\u0026quot;AWS_RStudio\u0026quot;). Now we can open our script as we would do in our local RStudio and do whatever we need to do with it, including running it.\n(14) Going back the script When the script runs, we can close our browser, and just forget about it. To go back to our instance, we go again on the AWS webpage, we login to our account, and we click the EC2 service.\nWe should have one instance running. Clicking on it, we are back to the instance console (see point 8), from where, following again points 8 and 9, we go again on our virtual RStudio.\n(15) Terminate the instance When the script is finished, and if we do not have anything else to run, from the instance console we can \u0026ldquo;terminate\u0026rdquo; the instance, as shown below. All done!\nLimitations This quick tutorial is intended as a very basic shortcut to run RStudio on AWS. The pros are that it works, that it should have you run a R script in a handful of minutes and that it does not require any technical knowledge. On the other hand, there are some obvious limitations (all suggestions are more than welcome!):\n  I have not been able to write output files on my local computer. While the modifications of the scripts I made in the instance are saved on my Dropbox, the output files, produced with write_csv(\u0026quot;myLongScriptOutput.csv\u0026quot;) are not. They appear in the \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; tab in the virtual RStudio and I manually export them from there to my computer (\u0026ldquo;More\u0026gt;Export\u0026rdquo;). This is not very elegant.\n  The virtual RStudio comes with some packages pre-installed. In particular, the \u0026ldquo;tidyverse\u0026rdquo; package, which is the only one I needed, is there. I did not try to install any other package, so I do not know whether this will work straightforwardly or not.\n  The most annoying aspect is that my script runs slower in the cloud that on my laptop! (Around twice slower.) This is probably due to the fact that I am using a \u0026ldquo;Free Tier\u0026rdquo; instance, so I would need to pay for more computational power. So, this is a viable option if you are not exactly in a rush, unless someone finds a solution to this.\n  Finally, I just scratched the surface of what one can do (again the goal was to provide a fast and easy solution). I do not have idea of how the majority of the options present in the instance console work, and I did not mention few for which I have some idea. (For example, how to monitor your script, or how to pair your instance with a ssh key so to access it directly from terminal, see point 6).\n   As usual, comments and feedback welcome, and happy to know about better solutions!\n","date":1569283200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569283200,"objectID":"87b40291858af4aabcb977bf88149e21","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_aws_rstudio/","publishdate":"2019-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_aws_rstudio/","section":"post","summary":"Running your R scripts in the cloud is as simple as that (and free).","tags":["software","RStudio"],"title":"RStudio on Amazon Web Services","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567987200,"objectID":"204363624c4d349e73a8c2b9bd81c287","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/lepoint/","publishdate":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/lepoint/","section":"media","summary":"An article on my research on cognitive attraction and misinformation (in french).","tags":null,"title":"Les vraies raisons du succès des infox","type":"media"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I started my academic career as a modeller (in fact, as an artificial life/robotics researcher: this is my first publication ever), and I continue to believe that computational models are a fundamental tool to develop research in cultural evolution.

Among the many interesting pieces of information, not surprisingly, attitudes towards vaccinations are starting to be widely discussed in the press.\nThe first important thing to notice, as the Wellcome Trust correctly does, is that ‘worldwide, 79% of people agree that vaccines are safe and 84% agree that they are effective’ and ‘92% of parents worldwide said that their children have received a vaccine to prevent them from getting childhood diseases .’ Whatever we may think, the majority of people around the world rightly believe that vaccines are good. Of course, there is a minority of people, especially in western countries, that is less convinced of that. Citing again the Wellcome Trust, ‘In France, one in three people disagree that vaccines are safe, the highest percentage for any country worldwide’. The France figure is, however, one of few outliers, also for western countries, where the averages of people disagreeing that vaccines are safe are around 10%.\nStill, that one out of ten persons in western countries could think as such is worrying. Not surprisingly, social media has been identified as one of the culprits of this situation, and I bet that, following the Wellcome Trust survey, the trend will continue (I already found one article here). Out of curiosity, I correlated the Wellcome trust data with recent data on social media penetration/usage in Europe, and they are not correlated.\nWhile I was on it, I also correlated the data with the importance of religion..\n\u0026hellip;the trust in science\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and the GDP pro capita\nNaturally, this is a very basic analysis. It could be for example that, within countries, people that are sceptical of vaccines use more social media than others. That anti-vaxx information spreads effectively in social media is not surprising. There are many reasons why anti-vaccination beliefs are easy to spread (and, conversely, it could be more difficult with pro-vaccination beliefs). Information around vaccines is psychologically attractive, involving potentially disgust and counterintuitive concepts that, coupled with a possible negative bias, make fearmongering on vaccines a good topic for online misinformation. All of this, however, is not a prerogative of digital social media (where correct, pro-vaccine, information also spreads effectively), and vaccine hesitancy is as old as vaccines themselves.\nIn any case, each time you hear someone saying, or writing, that anti-vaccination beliefs are linked to social media you should be sceptical. At least: it is not obvious.\nIf you are interested, all the technical stuff (data, R script, what I coded exactly as “vaccine hesitancy”, “social media penetration”, etc.) are in this GitHub repository.\n","date":1560988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560988800,"objectID":"ed8066c56cb76143c6339aa8d77a6fbe","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_wellcome/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_wellcome/","section":"post","summary":"Data from Wellcome Trust shows no correlation between social media usage and negative opinions towards vaccination.","tags":["big questions","digital age"],"title":"Vaccine hesitancy is not correlated with social media penetration at country-level in Europe","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"You have probably heard the adagio that “man bites dog”, and not “dog bites man”, makes for a good piece of news: unusual, exceptional, events are better stories than everyday occurrences. Hidden behind the surface, however, there is another message that seems so obvious we do not even think about it: both examples are negative events. “Dog wins the lottery” would probably be a good piece of news too, but it is not mentioned. That negative news – and possibly negative narratives in general – are more attractive than positive ones is a bit of a cliché, but it supported by much research.\nAn interesting case-study is false news. By definition, they do not need to describe real facts, so they can exploit our preferences in an almost unconstrained way. In a content analysis of a small sample of articles categorised as online misinformation, I found that negative articles where around five times more numerous than positive articles. It is not just about news. English-language fiction became consistently more negative in the last two centuries, and English-language song lyrics did the same in the last fifty years.\nAnd why, yet, this should be the case? There are many possible explanations: one is that the stories we tell each other are simulations. As much as pilots can exercise their flight skills in dangerous situations safe from risks in a simulator, the pleasure we experience when we enjoy narratives would be rooted in the possibility of exercise our skills in an analogous safe environment. The next time you are in the woods you should be suspicious of the wolf.\nFrom this perspective, it makes sense that negative events are predominant in stories: it is worst to arrive unprepared to a negative event than to a positive one. Some research has explored the idea that, in fact, not generally negative events, but threats are what narratives are about. It does not matter how realistic the threats are: you can enjoy watching The Haunting of Hill House even if you do not think ghosts exist or sharing the dubious news about a morgue employee cremated while taking a nap even if you do not usually hang out in morgues.\nIn a recently published paper, Olivier Morin, Oleg Sobchuk, and I, tried to explore further the threath simulation hypothesis. We found two problems with how the hypothesis is often presented. First, it leaves unspecified which kind of threats should be simulated in narratives. Second, and related, it is not clear whether it is a “theory of fictional content”, i.e. it applies specifically to fictional narratives, or to a more wide range of contents, since, as we saw before, also news tend to bend toward the negative (but also, for example, dreams have been interpreted in the same way).\nIn the paper, we explore a more exacting version of the hypothesis, that we called the Ordeals simulation hypothesis (mainly Olivier’s brainchild). The hypothesis specifies that neither negative events in general, nor threats in general, should be overrepresented in fiction, but ordeals. Ordeals – the meaning is different from the usage of the term in common language – are threats that are severe, rare, and reactable. ‘Reactable’ here means that we cannot prevent them (as we can do for, say, cardiovascular diseases or pathogen contamination), but they are also not completely out of our control (like being struck by lighting). Aggressions, violent social interactions and, most of all, homicides, are all examples of ordeals.\nThe first question is then whether ordeals are overrepresented in fiction with respect to other threats, or, to take a clear case: why do people die in novels? The ordeal simulation hypothesis predicts that agentive or accidental deaths (such as homicides or calamities), but not natural deaths, should be overrepresented. (Game of Thrones is too easy of an example, but I recently read that the currently much talked Chernobyl series may have exaggerated the number of deaths). We coded hundreds of summaries of novels in wikipedia: mortality rates of novels’ characters are disproportionally high, when compared to realistic estimates. For 100,000 adults in US, between 100 and 200 deaths are estimated every year. But, in novels, we calculated this figure as 19,000, that is, three orders of magnitude higher. The realistic rate for agentive death is only 31 over 100,000, but in novels is more than 13,000. Natural deaths are also overrepresented, but less so: in reality the rate is higher than agentive deaths (107 on 100,000), while in novels is only around 2,000. (Much more in the paper.)\nThe second question is whether the prominence of agentive deaths is a specific feature of fiction with respect to other kinds of content. To explore this, we used a different methodology: we performed a computer text analysis of two large, comparable, corpora, one of novels and one of private letters and diaries, to detect the frequencies of words related to death in general, and to agentive death (‘kill’, ‘murder’, ‘execution’, etc.) in particular. The ordeal simulation hypothesis would predict that the frequency of agentive death-related words would be higher in the novels than in the private documents, but no difference should be found for general death-related words. In this case, the prediction was not confirmed: mentions of death, both violent and non-violent, were about equally frequent in fictional and non-fictional material.\nWhat can we conclude from all that? Agentive deaths are overrepresented in fiction, but they are also, so it seems, overrepresented in material written without the intention of being made public. Perhaps the ordeal simulation hypothesis is not on the right track. My opinion, however, is that the problem may lie in finding an explanation that works for, and only for, fictional material. From the psychological point of view, how different is to read a true story, a piece of news, or a novel? (agentive deaths sure are overrepresented in news, see the plot below – full study here)\nHow different is to write a novel, a diary entry, or a letter? Perhaps there is no specific feature that makes fictions different from other materials, besides, as suggested before when mentioning misinformation, bigger freedom of explore possible contents. Maybe developing a “theory of fiction” (that works only for fiction) is misguided. There are various elements that make narratives (fiction, diaries, news, but also scientific theories, political orientations, etc.) attractive, these elements are the legitimate objects of study, and we can apply them to various domains, fiction included.\nHere the paper, and if you are really interested, all the data and codes for the analysis.

An influential family of theories sees fiction as rooted in adaptive simulation mechanisms. In this view, our propensity to create and enjoy narrative fictions was selected and maintained due to the training that we get from mentally simulating situations relevant to our survival and reproduction. We put forward and test a precise version of this claim, the “ordeal simulation hypothesis”. It states that fictional narrative primarily simulates “ordeals”\u0026#58; situations where a person’s reaction might dramatically improve or decrease her fitness, such as deadly aggressions, or decisions on long-term matrimonial commitments. Experience does not prepare us well for these rare, high-stakes occasions, in contrast with situations that are just as fitness-relevant but more frequent (e.g., exposure to pathogens). We study mortality in fictional and non-fictional texts as a partial test for this view. Based on an analysis of 744 extensive summaries of twentieth century American novels of various genres, we show that the odds of dying (in a given year) are vastly exaggerated in fiction compared to reality, but specifically more exaggerated for homicides as compared to suicides, accidents, war-related, or natural deaths. This evidence supports the ordeal simulation hypothesis but is also compatible with other accounts. For a more specific test, we look for indications that this focus on death, and in particular on death caused by an agent, is specific to narrative fiction as distinct from other verbal productions. In a comparison of 10,810 private letters and personal diary entries written by American women, with a set of 811 novels (also written by American women), we measure the occurrence of words related to natural death or agentive death. Private letters and diaries are as likely, or more likely, to use words relating to natural or agentive death. Novels written for an adult audience contain more words relating to natural deaths than do letters (though not diary entries), but this is not true for agentive death. Violent death, in spite of its clear appeal for fiction, does not necessarily provide a clear demarcation point between fictional and non-fictional content.","tags":["cultural evolution","evolutionary psychology","text mining","fiction"],"title":"Why people die in novels: Testing the ordeal simulation hypothesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558537200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558537200,"objectID":"dadb519de14694930a69a9085eeb563e","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2019_brunel/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_brunel/","section":"talk","summary":"The spread of online misinformation has gained mainstream attention in recent years and it is often touted as one of the biggest threat to a well-functioning society. However, the scientific consensus on the prominence and on the actual effect of online misinformation is, at best, mixed. This is consistent with an image of relatively wary learners, that stems from some cognitive and evolutionary approaches to culture. Here I analyse misinformation focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive preferences. The research involves 260 articles from media outlets included in two authoritative lists of websites known for publishing hoaxes and ‘fake news’, tracking the presence of negative content, threat-related information, presence of sexually related material, elements associated to disgust, minimally counterintuitive elements (and a particular category of them, i.e., violations of essentialist beliefs), and social information, intended as presence of salient social interactions (e.g., gossip, cheating, formation of alliances), and as news about celebrities. The analysis shows that these features are, to a different degree, present in most texts, and thus that general cognitive inclinations may contribute to explain the success of online misinformation. Online misinformation, while being an umbrella term covering many different phenomena, can be characterised, in this perspective, not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency. The difference is that ‘quality’ is not equated to truthfulness but to psychological appeal.","tags":[],"title":"Cognitive attraction and online misinformation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"I have been involved, over the weekend, in a small twitter debate on the old question of whether anthropology should use qualitative or quantitative methodologies. The debate was not particularly interesting by itself (I had many, probably too many, similar conversations starting when I was an undergraduate student) and the readers of this blog know, or suspect, my position, so I am not dwelling on it. There is, however, a marginal aspect that made me think a bit: I have the feeling that, when it is all said and done, the negative attitudes toward quantifications are linked to the idea that quantifying human culture is politically “neoliberal”, if not altogether “right-wing”.\nI am sure that no critic of quantification in anthropology will accept this as their own position and they will express more cogent (at least from their point of view) arguments. It does not matter: I am happy to explore a straw man here. (A tweet that was stating it explicitly appeared at some point over the weekend, and it was “liked” by one of the persons involved in the debate, but that is just a side-note, a “like” on Twitter does not need to mean anything.)\nWhereas I can grasp why some evolutionary approaches can be considered as supporting neoliberal social policies – even though I think the question is more nuanced and complicated – how can quantification by itself be? Is studying how movies influence the popularity of dog breeds neoliberal? Is it counting how many different folktales there are in different populations? Is cultural evolution, intended as a general project of applying scientific and quantitative methods to the study of culture, neoliberal?\nEnough with rhetorical questions, but I would be interested if anybody knows any scholarly reference or developed argument that support this position (again, I know, it is a straw man). The only reason I can think of is that, in the last decades, researchers working on quantitative approaches to culture have been less active in political matters than researchers working on qualitative approaches, even though my impression is that the formers are politically leaning left as much as the rest of social scientists (at least the people that refer to the “cultural evolution” label).\nI am really not interested in starting a debate, but perhaps there are reasons for considering quantification as such, and I’d be happy to exploit collective intelligence to know more (as said, possibly in the form of scholarly publications, etc.).

Culture can be studied as an evolving system, and the comparison between biological and cultural evolution has inspired a productive research agenda in which cultural stability is commonly attributed to the existence of mechanisms of high-fidelity cultural transmission. Other researchers have argued that no such copying processes are necessary to explain cultural stability, and that stability can also emerge as a by-product of convergent transformation (in which an item causes the production of another item whose form tends to deviate from that of the original item in a non random way). To investigate this issue, we present a series of stochastic simulation models of cultural evolution that make no prior assumptions about the type of processes by which cultural units propagate through a population. Results show that cultural stability can emerge and be maintained by convergent transformation alone, even in the absence of any form of copying or selection process. We also show that high-fidelity copying and convergent transformation are, contrary to some previous arguments, not opposing forces, and can in fact jointly contribute to cultural stability. Finally, we analyse how convergent transformation and high-fidelity copying can have different evolutionary signatures at the level of the population, and hence how their differing effects can be distinguished in the empirical record.

The scientific consensus on the prominence and on the effect of online misinformation, however, is, at best, mixed.\nSome highly-publicised studies had supported the scaremongers showing, for example, that falsehood spread farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth or that ‘low-quality’ information is equally likely to go ‘viral’ than ‘hi-quality’ information because of our ‘limited attention’ (notice however that the former study does not compare ‘falsehood’ with ‘truth’, but debunked rumours versus confirmed rumours, so that real news that nobody debunked, i.e. the majority of them, are not even considered, and the latter has been recently retracted).\nMany other works, however, had painted a more nuanced image, showing that the production and the consumption of misinformation is concentrated in a limited portion of social media users, that individuals that have already extreme political views are more likely to be exposed to political misinformation, and that, in general, misinformation is unlikely to change people minds. And, simply, other studies have shown that the actual amount of online misinformation is not that big.\nYet, the narrative supporting that online misinformation is dangerous is itself very persuasive. It is easier to think that the people that voted Trump (you can replace this with whatever you do not like) have been manipulated by evil figures, and if they would have access to the correct information they would have done the right thing. This narrative is also quite dangerous, I think, because creates an easy scapegoat (you can make up any newspaper article with this schema: “How [name of social media] helped [thing that you do not like]”) that often distract to more relevant social, economic, and cultural problems.\nAlso, this narrative does not fit particularly well with an evolutionary account of human behaviour. We are a species that heavily relies on communication, social interactions, and learning from others. While details widely vary, researchers studying cultural evolution and cognition agree that, for the characteristics allowing communication, social interactions, and learning from others to be evolved in the first place, we should not be too gullible. Of course, the conditions could be so different now that we could be more easily tricked, but this is an open question, and, given a ‘presumption of good design’, we should be at least sceptical of answers that are too pessimistic.\nGiven this somewhat reassuring perspective, however, online misinformation does exist, and one can ask what the possible advantages of misinformation could be. In a recent paper, I proposed that one of these could simply be that misinformation can be manufactured building on features that make it attractive in an almost unconstrained way, whereas ‘true’ news cannot, simply because they need to correspond to reality. Misinformation can be designed to spread more than real information does (whether this is a conscious process or not). Cognitive anthropologists have put forward features that make some content, everything else equal, more appealing, memorable, or attention-grabbing than other content.\nHere is an example: many misinformation articles (I examine a small sample of ‘fake news’ from 2017: all the material, including the links and the texts used, is here) contains threat-related information, even though threats do not need to be relevant for us (as in the article that gives the title to this blog post: not many of us usually take naps in a morgue. Still, the false news has been shared/liked/commented more than one million times on Facebook). Other features (negative content, disgust, etc.) and many more details are explained in the paper.\nMisinformation is not low-quality information that succeeds in spreading because of the shortcomings of online communication. Quite the opposite, misinformation, or at least some of it, is high-quality information that spreads because online communication is efficient. The difference is that ‘quality’ is not about truthfulness, but about how it fits with our cognitive predispositions. Online “fake news”, is, from this perspective, not much of a political and propagandistic phenomenon, but is more similar to the diffusion of memes, urban legends, and the like (of course political misinformation exist, even though, interestingly, often takes advantage of similar cognitive preferences to spread, think about the notorious Pizzagate, with its mix of threat, sex, and disgust).\nThe paper is part of a Cultural evolution collection, edited by Jamie Tehrani, and I invite you to have a look at the other articles too!\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"f54fc80d5946919a1d67e4d86d306f6b","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/post/2019_morgue/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_morgue/","section":"post","summary":"My new paper on cognitive attraction and online misinformatin.","tags":["digital age","my research"],"title":"Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":" I wrote a presentation of the research behind the paper in this blog post.\nAn article (in Italian) summarising the paper.\nAnother popular article (in French).\n  ","date":1549929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549929600,"objectID":"d936b6b0ed684c2e5d240a7d31991ba2","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_pal_comm_a/","publishdate":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_pal_comm_a/","section":"publication","summary":"The spread of online misinformation has gained mainstream attention in recent years. This paper approaches this phenomenon from a cultural evolution and cognitive anthropology perspective, focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive preferences. This research involves 260 articles from media outlets included in two authoritative lists of websites known for publishing hoaxes and ‘fake news’, tracking the presence of negative content, threat-related information, presence of sexually related material, elements associated to disgust, minimally counterintuitive elements (and a particular category of them, i.e., violations of essentialist beliefs), and social information, intended as presence of salient social interactions (e.g., gossip, cheating, formation of alliances), and as news about celebrities. The analysis shows that these features are, to a different degree, present in most texts, and thus that general cognitive inclinations may contribute to explain the success of online misinformation. This account can elucidate questions such as whether and why misinformation online is thriving more than accurate information, or the role of ‘fake news’ as a weapon of political propaganda. Online misinformation, while being an umbrella term covering many different phenomena, can be characterised, in this perspective, not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency. The difference is that ‘quality’ is not equated to truthfulness but to psychological appeal.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","misinformation","digital media"],"title":"Cognitive attraction and online misinformation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas J.

One commonly studied learning mechanism is a disproportionate preference for majority opinions, known as conformist transmission. While most theoretical and experimental work approaches the majority in terms of the number of individuals that perform a behaviour or hold a belief, some recent experimental studies approach the majority in terms of the number of instances a behaviour is performed. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that disagreement between these two notions of the majority can arise when behavioural variants are performed at different rates, with different salience or in different contexts (variant overrepresentation) and when a subset of the population act as demonstrators to the whole population (model biases). We also show that because conformist transmission changes the distribution of behaviours in a population, how observers approach the majority can cause populations to diverge, and that this can happen even when the two approaches to the majority agree with regards to which behaviour is in the majority. We discuss these results in light of existing findings, ranging from political extremism on twitter to studies of animal foraging behaviour. We conclude that the factors we considered (variant overrepresentation and model biases) are plausibly widespread. As such, it is important to understand how individuals approach the majority in order to understand the effects of majority influence in cultural evolution.","tags":["cultural evolution","transmission biases","individual based models"],"title":"Copy-the-majority of instances or individuals?

In this review I propose that cultural evolution theory, including both a sophisticated view of human behavior and a methodological attitude to modeling and quantitative analysis, provides a useful framework to study the effects and the developments of media in the digital age. I will first give a general presentation of the cultural evolution framework, and I will then introduce this more specific research program with two illustrative topics. The first topic concerns how cultural transmission biases, that is, simple heuristics such as “copy prestigious individuals” or “copy the majority,” operate in the novel context of digital media. The existence of transmission biases is generally justified with their adaptivity in small-scale societies. How do they operate in an environment where, for example, prestigious individuals possess not-relevant skills, or popularity is explicitly quantified and advertised? The second aspect relates to fidelity of cultural transmission. Digitally-mediated interactions support cheap and immediate high-fidelity transmission, in opposition, for example, to oral traditions. How does this change the content that is more likely to spread? Overall, I suggest the usefulness of a “long view” to our contemporary digital environment, contextualized in cognitive science and cultural evolution theory, and I discuss how this perspective could help us to understand what is genuinely new and what is not.","tags":["cultural evolution","misinformation","digital media","transmission biases"],"title":"A cultural evolution approach to digital media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edwin J.

However, ambiguity within and across disciplines remains as to how to identify conformist transmission empirically. In most studies, a population level outcome has been taken as the benchmark to evidence conformist transmission: a sigmoidal relation between individuals’ probability to copy the majority and the proportional majority size. Using an individual-based model, we show that, under ecologically plausible conditions, this sigmoidal relation can also be detected without equipping individuals with a conformist bias. Situations in which individuals copy randomly from a fixed subset of demonstrators in the population, or in which they have a preference for one of the possible variants, yield similar sigmoidal patterns as a conformist bias would. Our findings warrant a revisiting of studies that base their conformist transmission conclusions solely on the sigmoidal curve. More generally, our results indicate that population level outcomes interpreted as conformist transmission could potentially be explained by other individual-level strategies, and that more empirical support is needed to prove the existence of an individual-level conformist bias in human and other animals.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models","transmission biases"],"title":"Conformity cannot be identified based on population-level signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Claudio Tennie","Alex Mesoudi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"1fb7608125fede9b266cfb76bab07a67","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_rsos/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_rsos/","section":"publication","summary":"The extensive use of social learning is considered a major reason for the ecological success of humans. Theoretical considerations, models and experiments have explored the evolutionary basis of social learning, showing the conditions under which learning from others is more adaptive than individual learning.

Individuals can modify their arrowhead either by individual trial and error or by copying others. We study how, in a multimodal adaptive landscape, the smoothness of the peaks influences learning. We compare narrow peaks, in which solutions close to optima do not provide useful feedback to individuals, to wide peaks, where smooth landscapes allow an effective hill-climbing individual learning strategy. We show that individual learning is more difficult in narrow-peaked landscapes, but that social learners perform almost equally well in both narrow- and wide-peaked search spaces. There was a weak trend for more copying in the narrow than wide condition, although as in previous experiments social information was generally underutilized. Our results highlight the importance of tasks’ design space when studying the adaptiveness of high-fidelity social learning.","tags":["cultural evolution","experiment"],"title":"Social learning solves the problem of narrow-peaked search landscapes: experimental evidence in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Claudio Tennie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"728e9b41f240beaddf6afcf54e50f9fc","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_jcp/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_jcp/","section":"publication","summary":"Redundant copying has been proposed as a manner to achieve the high-fidelity necessary to pass on and preserve complex traits in human cultural transmission. There are at least 2 ways to define redundant copying. One refers to the possibility of copying repeatedly the same trait over time, and another to the ability to exploit multiple layers of information pointing to the same trait during a single copying event. Using an individual-based model, we explore how redundant copying (defined as in the latter way) helps to achieve successful transmission. The authors show that increasing redundant copying increases the likelihood of accurately transmitting a behavior more than either augmenting the number of copying occasions across time or boosting the general accuracy of social learning. They also investigate how different cost functions, deriving, for example, from the need to invest more energy in cognitive processing, impact the evolution of redundant copying. The authors show that populations converge either to high-fitness/high-costs states (with high redundant copying and complex culturally transmitted behaviors; resembling human culture) or to low-fitness/low-costs states (with low redundant copying and simple transmitted behaviors; resembling social learning forms typical of nonhuman animals). This outcome may help to explain why cumulative culture is rare in the animal kingdom.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"The role of redundant information in cultural transmission and cultural stabilization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1445817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445817600,"objectID":"b19a1f71841e85b80e7f7992d899b04b","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/plato/","publishdate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/plato/","section":"media","summary":"Philosopher Massmio Pigliucci discusses our *If we are all cultural darwinians, what is the fuss about?* on *Plato's Footnotes*.","tags":null,"title":"The Trouble with Cultural Evolution","type":"media"},{"authors":["Francesco Pugliese","Alberto Acerbi","Davide Marocco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441324800,"objectID":"0a11481589e8816129980cce3d47ffda","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2015_plos/","publishdate":"2015-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_plos/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we examine the factors contributing to the emergence of leadership in a group, and we explore the relationship between the role of the leader and the behavioural capabilities of other individuals.

Yet how far the analogy be- tween cultural and genetic evolution should be pushed is open to debate. Here, we examine a recent disagreement that concerns the extent to which cultural trans- mission should be considered a preservative mechanism allowing selection among different variants, or a transformative process in which individuals recreate variants each time they are transmitted. The latter is associated with the notion of \"cultural attraction\". This issue has generated much misunderstanding and confusion. We first clarify the respective positions, noting that there is in fact no substantive incompatibility between cultural attraction and standard cultural evolution ap- proaches, beyond a difference in focus. Whether cultural transmission should be considered a preservative or reconstructive process is ultimately an empirical question, and we examine how both preservative and reconstructive cultural transmission has been studied in recent experimental research in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss how the relative importance of preservative and reconstructive processes may depend on the granularity of analysis and the domain being studied.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction"],"title":"If we are all cultural Darwinians what’s the fuss about?

They are ubiquitous in human societies, and have recently been used as a source of data to test models of cultural dynamics. Although a few statistical regularities have been observed in fashion cycles, their empirical characterization is still incomplete. Here we consider the impact of mass media on popular culture, showing that the release of movies featuring dogs is often associated with an increase in the popularity of featured breeds, for up to 10 years after movie release. We also find that a movie's impact on breed popularity correlates with the estimated number of viewers during the movie's opening weekend—a proxy of the movie's reach among the general public. Movies' influence on breed popularity was strongest in the early 20th century, and has declined since. We reach these conclusions through a new, widely applicable method to measure the cultural impact of events, capable of disentangling the event's effect from ongoing cultural trends.","tags":["cultural evolution"],"title":"Dog Movies Stars and Dog Breed Popularity: A Case Study in Media Influence on Choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","R.

A relatively large share of older individuals, in fact, allows a population to retain more culture, and a large culture can change in more directions than a small culture.

Recently, however, it has been questioned whether non-human social learning is faithful enough to stabilize those patterns. The observed stability could be interpreted as a result of various constraints that limit the number of possible alternative behaviors, rather than of the fidelity of transmission mechanisms. Those constraints can be roughly described as “internal”, such as mechanical (bodily) properties or cognitive limitations and predispositions, and “external”, such as ecological availability or pressures. Here we present an evolutionary individual-based model that explores the relationships between the evolution of faithful social learning and behavioral constraints, represented both by the size of the behavioral repertoire and by the “shape” of the search space of a given task. We show that the evolution of high-fidelity transmission mechanisms, when associated with costs (e.g. cognitive, biomechanical, energetic, etc.), is only likely if the potential behavioral repertoire of a species is large and if the search space does not provide information that can be exploited by individual learning. Moreover we show how stable behavioral patterns (“traditions”) can be achieved at the population level as an outcome of both high-fidelity and low-fidelity transmission mechanisms, given that the latter are coupled with a small behavioral repertoire or with a search space that provide substantial feedback. Finally, by introducing the possibility of environmental change, we show that intermediate rates of change favor the evolution of faithful social learning.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","individual based models"],"title":"Behavioral constraints and the evolution of faithful social learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Stefano Ghirlanda","Magnus Enquist"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1331078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1331078400,"objectID":"2ff0f3ad402d914396db25ca5629fc8f","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2012_plos/","publishdate":"2012-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_plos/","section":"publication","summary":"Many cultural traits exhibit volatile dynamics, commonly dubbed fashions or fads.

We then simulate the coevolution between many cultural traits and the associated preferences, reproducing power-law frequency distributions of cultural traits (most traits are adopted by few individuals for a short time, and very few by many for a long time), as well as correlations between the rate of increase and the rate of decrease of traits (traits that increase rapidly in popularity are also abandoned quickly and vice versa).

We propose a decomposition of these learning mechanisms (plus pure individual learning) that incorporates the core idea that social learning can be represented as a search for an optimal behavior that is constrained by different kinds of information. We illustrate our approach with an individual-based model in which individuals solve tasks in abstract “spaces” that represent behavioral actions, results, and benefits of those results. Depending on the learning mechanisms at their disposal, individuals have differential access to the information conveyed in these spaces. We show how different classes of tasks may provide distinct advantages to individuals with different learning mechanisms and discuss how our approach contributes to current empirical and theoretical research on social learning and culture.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"Modeling imitation and emulation in constrained search spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Charles L.

In condition 1, we found that monophasic predators (i.e. with one sleep bout per 24 h) select for monophasic prey that sleep perfectly out of phase with predators. In condition 2, predators were monophasic but the safety of prey varied as a function of their activity (sleeping versus awake). In this condition, the prey adjusted their sleeping behaviour to lower the risk of predation. Finally, in condition 3, we modelled a more dynamic interaction between predator and prey, with predator activity dependent on prey activity in the previous hour. In this scenario, the prey adjusted their behaviour relative to one another, resulting in either greater or lesser synchrony in prey as a function of predator searching behaviour. Collectively, our model demonstrates that predator behaviour can have a strong influence on prey sleep patterns, including whether prey are monophasic or polyphasic (i.e. with many sleep bouts per 24 h). The model further suggests that the timing of sleep relative to predator behaviour may depend strongly on how other potential prey partition the activity period.","tags":["sleep","individual based models"],"title":"Predation and the phasing of sleep: an evolutionary individual-based model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Ghirlanda","Alberto Acerbi","Magnus Enquist","Mayuko Makamaru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1270080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1270080000,"objectID":"4314adde5c38ad457e3adaf204f8fbb9","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2010_cur_anthr/","publishdate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010_cur_anthr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"The Sometimes Evitable Route to Conservatism and Persuasiveness.

We assume that individuals observe cultural traits displayed by others and decide whether to copy them based on their overall preference for the displayed traits. Preferences, too, can be transmitted between individuals. Our results show that such cultural dynamics tends to produce conservative individuals, i.e., individuals who are reluctant to copy new traits. Openness to new information, however, can be maintained when individuals need significant time to acquire the cultural traits that make them effective cultural models. We show that a gradual enculturation of young individuals by many models and a larger cultural repertoire to be acquired are favorable circumstances for the long-term maintenance of openness in individuals and groups. Our results agree with data about lifetime personality change, showing that openness to new information decreases with age. Our results show that cultural remodeling of cultural transmission is a powerful force in cultural evolution, i.e., that cultural evolution can change its own dynamics.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"Cultural evolution and individual development of openness and conservatism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Davide Marocco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1245369600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1245369600,"objectID":"baa96829fd8b8c7c53cccd46f075d5c8","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/cp_2009_orienting/","publishdate":"2009-06-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cp_2009_orienting/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the advantages of sociality resides in the opportunity of exploiting the behavior of other individuals of the same group as a reliable source of information.

Here we address these questions using an evolutionary agent-based model. The model is spatially explicit, with food and sleep sites distributed in two clusters on the landscape. Agents acquire food and sleep energy based on an internal circadian clock coded by 24 traits (one for each hour of the day) that correspond to \"genes\" that evolve by means of a genetic algorithm. These traits can assume three different values that specify the agents' behavior\u0026#58; sleep (or search for a sleep site), eat (or search for a food site), or flexibly decide action based on relative levels of sleep energy and food energy. Individuals with higher fitness scores leave more offspring in the next generation of the simulation, and the model can therefore be used to identify evolutionarily adaptive circadian clock parameters under different ecological conditions. We systematically varied input parameters related to the number of food and sleep sites, the degree to which food and sleep sites overlap, and the rate at which food patches were depleted. Our results reveal that\u0026#58; (1) the increased costs of traveling between more spatially separated food and sleep clusters select for monophasic sleep, (2) more rapid food patch depletion reduces sleep times, and (3) agents spend more time attempting to acquire the \"rarer\" resource, that is, the average time spent sleeping is positively correlated with the number of food patches and negatively correlated with the number of sleep patches. \"Flexible\" genes, in general, do not appear to be advantageous, though their arrangements in the agents' genome show characteristic patterns that suggest that selection acts on their distribution. Collectively, the output suggests that ecological factors can have striking effects on sleep patterns. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a simple model can produce clear and sensible patterns, thus allowing it to be used to investigate a wide range of questions concerning the ecology of sleep. Quantitative data presently are unavailable to test the model predictions directly, but patterns are consistent with comparative evidence from different species, and the model can be used to target ecological factors to investigate in future research.","tags":["sleep","individual based models"],"title":"To sleep or not to sleep: the ecology of sleep in artificial organisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"e9fe2c4cd58723efcaadef75825e998f","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2008_trasmissioni/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2008_trasmissioni/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","in Italian"],"title":"Le trasmissioni della cultura","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1194048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1194048000,"objectID":"4ab571d548b81e34a2fd7a55e33ca8ae","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2007_phd/","publishdate":"2007-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2007_phd/","section":"publication","summary":"My PhD Thesis.","tags":["cultural evolution","ALife/robotics","in Italian"],"title":"La natura della cultura.
