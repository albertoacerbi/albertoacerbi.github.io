Research in cultural evolution theory distinguishes factors related to social influence (such as copying from the majority, or from certain individuals) from factors related to individual, nonsocially influenced, propensities such as evolved cognitive predispositions, or physical, biological, and environmental constraints. Here, we show, using analytical and individual-based models, that individual preferences, even when weak, determine the equilibrium point of cultural dynamics when acting together with nondirectional social influence in three out of four cases we study. The results have implications regarding the importance of keeping into account individual-level, nonsocial, factors, when studying cultural evolution, as well as regarding the interpretation of cross-cultural regularities, that must be expected, but can be product of weak directional forces, intensified by social influence.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","modelling"],"title":"Weak individual preferences stabilize culture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chiara Bonacchi","Marta Krzyzanska","Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1736899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1736899200,"objectID":"1011e58779401a70f87cf8d351ef3b61","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2025_scirep_archeo/","publishdate":"2025-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025_scirep_archeo/","section":"publication","summary":"This study investigates the dissemination of archaeological information on Twitter/X through the lens of cultural evolution. By analysing 132,230 tweets containing the hashtag #archaeology from 2021 to 2023, we examine how content and context-related factors influence retweeting behaviour. Our findings reveal that tweets with positive sentiment and non-threatening language are more likely to be shared, contrasting with the common negativity bias observed on social media. Additionally, content authored by experts, particularly those with archaeological or historical expertise, is more frequently retweeted than content from popular figures lacking domain-specific expertise. The study also challenges the notion that pseudoarchaeology spreads rapidly and caution against overestimating its impact. Our results align with other studies on the spread of misinformation and “toxic” behaviour on social media, showing that the sharing of negative and hostile content by a vocal minority of users is mediated by other factors pertaining to the context of the communication. These insights underscore the nuanced dynamics of archaeology communication, emphasizing the importance of expert-led and positively charged narratives in engaging the public on social media.","tags":["digital media"],"title":"Positive sentiment and expertise predict the diffusion of archaeological content on social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1736726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1736726400,"objectID":"6e7a00327d114b0f69ed3941e958287f","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/unitrentomag/","publishdate":"2025-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/unitrentomag/","section":"media","summary":"What will the impact of technologies be on Generation Beta?

If these fears are to some extent warranted, the scientific literature suggests that many of them are exaggerated. Why are overly alarmist narratives about misinformation so popular? In two pre-registered experiments (N = 600, UK), replicated in the US (N = 601), we investigated the psychological factors associated with perceived danger of misinformation and how it contributes to the popularity of alarmist narratives on misinformation. We find that the strongest, and most reliable, predictor of perceived danger of misinformation is the third-person effect (i.e., the perception that others are more vulnerable to misinformation than the self) and, in particular, the belief that ‘distant’ others (as opposed to family and friends) are vulnerable to misinformation. The belief that societal problems have simple solutions and clear causes was consistently, but weakly, associated with perceived danger of online misinformation. Other factors, like negative attitudes towards new technologies and higher sensitivity to threats, were inconsistently, and weakly, associated with perceived danger of online misinformation. Finally, we found that participants who report being more worried about misinformation are more willing to like and share alarmist narratives on misinformation. Our findings suggest that alarmist narratives on misinformation tap into our tendency to view other people as gullible.","tags":["digital media","misinformation"],"title":"People believe misinformation is a threat because they assume others are gullible","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702598400,"objectID":"421b3546e1c23a0e61b7052feaa11c35","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/psypost_chat_gpt/","publishdate":"2023-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/psypost_chat_gpt/","section":"media","summary":"PsyPost covers our research on content biases in large lannguage models.","tags":["Recent"],"title":"OpenAI’s ChatGPT exhibits a surprisingly human-like transmission chain bias","type":"media"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702544400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702544400,"objectID":"52d51afc92c4420562f3c81562fca900","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2023_cudan/","publishdate":"2023-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2023_cudan/","section":"talk","summary":"As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows, it is important to examine if they exhibit biases in their output.

Given their scale, persistence, and impact, it is critically important to understand the mechanisms that caused these theories to spread. The aim of this preregistered study was to investigate whether retweet frequencies among proponents of voter fraud conspiracy theories on Twitter during the 2020 US election are consistent with frequency bias and/or content bias. To do this, we conducted generative inference using an agent-based model of cultural transmission on Twitter and the VoterFraud2020 dataset. The results show that the observed retweet distribution is consistent with a strong content bias causing users to preferentially retweet tweets with negative emotional valence. Frequency information appears to be largely irrelevant to future retweet count. Follower count strongly predicts retweet count in a simpler linear model but does not appear to drive the overall retweet distribution after temporal dynamics are accounted for. Future studies could apply our methodology in a comparative framework to assess whether content bias for emotional valence in conspiracy theory messages differs from other forms of information on social media.","tags":["digital media","misinformation","cultural evolution"],"title":"Negativity bias in the spread of voter fraud conspiracy theory tweets during the 2020 US election","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1689087600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689087600,"objectID":"39847f6e3581aa4d5ce398fba2f4c1ff","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2023_cppn/","publishdate":"2023-07-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2023_cppn/","section":"talk","summary":"Current widespread narrative states that misinformation is abundant on social media, it has a relative advantage with respect to true information, and it changes people attitudes and behaviours.

The chapter will then briefly consider possible future directions: the influence of different affordances in different media supporting cultural transmission; the role of producers of cultural traits; and, finally, the effects on cultural dynamics of algorithms selecting information.","tags":["cultural evolution","digital media"],"title":"Digital Culture","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675728000,"objectID":"fba7cbf121f4a2bd17aa05635271a549","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/psypost_misinfo/","publishdate":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/psypost_misinfo/","section":"media","summary":"A paper published in the journal Social Media + Society identifies six misconceptions about misinformation.","tags":null,"title":"New research highlights the misinformation about misinformation research","type":"media"},{"authors":["Sacha Altay","Manon Berriche","Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"731f98951776fa65587669ac7ef4faaf","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2023_misinfo_on_misinfo/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_misinfo_on_misinfo/","section":"publication","summary":"Alarmist narratives about online misinformation continue to gain traction despite evidence that its prevalence and impact are overstated. Drawing on research questioning the use of big data in social science and reception studies, we identify six misconceptions about misinformation and examine the conceptual and methodological challenges they raise. The first three misconceptions concern the prevalence and circulation of misinformation.First, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news,but with memes and entertaining content. Second, scientists focused on social media because it is methodologically convenient,but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Third, falsehoods don’t spread faster than the truth, how we define(mis)information influence sour results and their practical implications.The second three misconceptions concern the impact and the reception of misinformation.First, people don’t believe everything they see on the internet:sheer  volume  of  engagement  should  not  be  conflated  with  belief. Second, misinformation’s influence on people’s behavior is overblown since it often preaches to the choir. Third, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed, surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the  causal  influence  of  misinformation. To  appropriately  understand  and  fight misinformation, future research needs to address these challenges.","tags":["digital media","misinformation"],"title":"Misinformation on Misinformation: Conceptual and Methodological Challenges","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671112800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671112800,"objectID":"d9ff82c49ca60422fa8a313abd3bf2f1","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2022_aisc/","publishdate":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022_aisc/","section":"talk","summary":"A current widespread narrative states that misinformation is abundant on social media, it has a relative advantage with respect to true information, and it changes people attitudes and behaviours.

The presence of such patterns is often used to establish whether a species is cultural or not—i.e. whether a species uses social learning or not. Researchers using or describing this method have often pointed out that the method cannot pinpoint which specific type(s) of social learning resulted in the observed patterns. However, the literature continues to contain such inferences. In a new attempt to warn against these logically unwarranted conclusions, we illustrate this error using a novel approach. We use an individual-based model, focused on wild ape cultural patterns—as these patterns are the best-known cases of animal culture and as they also contain the most frequent usage of the unwarranted inference for specific social learning mechanisms. We built a model that contained agents unable to copy specifics of behavioural or artefact forms beyond their individual reach (which we define as “copying”). We did so, as some of the previous inference claims related to social learning mechanisms revolve around copying defined in this way. The results of our model however show that non-copying social learning can already reproduce the defining—even iconic—features of observed ape cultural patterns detected by the method of exclusion. This shows, using a novel model approach, that copying processes are not necessary to produce the cultural patterns that are sometimes still used in an attempt to identify copying processes. Additionally, our model could fully control for both environmental and genetic factors (impossible in real life) and thus offers a new validity check for the method of exclusion as related to general cultural claims—a check that the method passed. Our model also led to new and additional findings, which we likewise discuss.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"The method of exclusion (still) cannot identify specific mechanisms of cultural inheritance","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669572600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669572600,"objectID":"3e96eee6a6fc2c1f0cd23c8a53a41f2f","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2022_ecc/","publishdate":"2022-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022_ecc/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Negative sentiment online","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Sacco Pier Luigi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"06cff99e6e318637d71ba2fdf12f3776","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2022_jbee/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_jbee/","section":"publication","summary":"Within the conceptual framework of the Tightness-Looseness paradigm, we study the dynamics of the social salience of self-control (tight) vs-self-indulgence (loose) orientations across the 20th century on the basis of the English Google Books corpus, by means of the construction of specific lexica of which we track their relative frequencies. We find that whereas the trend of self-control displays a steady increase throughout, that of self-indulgence is U-shaped, so that following a decline along the most part of the century, starting from the late 70s-early 80s we observe a reversal of the trend that signals an increasing salience of self-indulgence. Such result seems to reflect the consumerist turn that has characterized the post-industrial cycle from the 80s onwards. The coexistence of growing trends for mutually antagonizing orientations calls for further analysis of their social interplay. We also perform a parallel analysis on semantically related lexica that confirms the robustness of our findings.","tags":["cultural evolution","text mining"],"title":"The self-control vs. self-indulgence dilemma.

Yet many researchers interested in cultural evolution come from backgrounds that lack training in formal modelling, such as psychology, anthropology or archaeology. This book addresses that gap.

Cumulative cultural evolution seems to vary across domains, with domains such as technology or science showing clear indications of cumulation, and others, such as the arts, less.\nHow can we explain this variability? Perhaps, different domains posses the features that enable cumulative cultural evolution to a different degree. Two of these features are availability, i.e., the possibility of accessing many examples from which to copy from, and fidelity of transmission, i.e., the cultural domain allows for reliable transmission that accurately preserves previous innovations - especially the improbable ones.\nOne can argue that the diffusion of digital, online, media is increasing availability and fidelity of transmission in domains where they were limited before. On one side, digital media enormously expand the potential network for cultural transmission. On the other side, they come together with several fidelity amplifiers, such as implementing cheap and fast high-fidelity replication, or providing tools, like videos or  comments, especially useful for the faithful transmission of tacit knowledge. In my talk, I will discuss this scenario, focusing especially on the possibility that digital media could improve cumulative cultural evolution in literature, a domain where it is (or it was) limited. I will present some results from a work-in-progress analysing Harry Potter fan fiction, where we were able to identify accumulation of themes and improvement in efficiency (as measured by readers' ratings), two signatures of cumulative cultural evolution.","tags":[],"title":"Can digital media boost cumulative cultural evolution in the arts?","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652968800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652968800,"objectID":"93765aced9efed51fdad23f5a44a9412","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2022_stockholm/","publishdate":"2022-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2022_stockholm/","section":"talk","summary":"In my talk, I will discuss how cultural evolution can provide a useful framework to understand how information is produced, transmitted, and selected in contemporary online, digital, media.\nI will touch topics such as how online media expanded the network where cultural transmission happens and increased fidelity of transmission; how this possibly impacts on cumulative cultural evolution, i.e. the increasing complexity of artefacts from one generation to another; or how, contrarily to contemporary worries, we are, on average, wary learners that are not easily influenced, online or offline.\nI will discuss more in detail how the (limited) spread of online misinformation can be seen from this perspective, focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive biases.

These experiments resemble oral storytelling, where individuals need to understand, memorise, and reproduce the content. However, prominent contemporary forms of cultural transmission—think an online sharing—only involve the willingness to transmit the content. Here I present two fully preregistered online experiments that explicitly investigated the differences between these two modalities of transmission. The first experiment (N=1080) examined whether negative content, information eliciting disgust, and threat-related information were better transmitted than their neutral counterpart in a traditional transmission chain set-up. The second experiment (N=1200), used the same material, but participants were asked whether they would share or not the content in two conditions, in a large anonymous social network, or with their friends, in their favourite social network. Negative content was both better transmitted in transmission chain experiments and shared more than its neutral counterpart. Threat-related information was successful in transmission chain experiments but not when sharing, and, finally, information eliciting disgust was not advantaged in either. Overall, the results present a composite picture, suggesting that the interactions between the specific content and the medium of transmission are important and, possibly, that content biases are stronger when memorisation and reproduction are involved in the transmission—like in oral transmission—than when they are not—like in online sharing. Negative content seems to be reliably favored in both modalities of transmission.","tags":["cultural evolution","digital media"],"title":"From storytelling to Facebook.

I will suggest some ways forward, including focusing on other aspects of the social/digital media system such as for example the online effectiveness of reliable news.","tags":[],"title":"Social influence and misinformation online","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642377600,"objectID":"84fe2f0ab01715dd5a7f88c1e0f0a963","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/futura/","publishdate":"2022-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/futura/","section":"media","summary":"An article on Futura Science (in French) on our model showing that focusing on engagment with true news is more productive than focusing on fighting misinformation.","tags":null,"title":"Se battre contre la désinformation ou pour l'information?","type":"media"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1642377600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1642377600,"objectID":"a641abc381f544e4b71438256cdea25c","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/niemanlab/","publishdate":"2022-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/niemanlab/","section":"media","summary":"Nieman Lab reports on our model on fighting misinformation VS fighting for information.","tags":null,"title":"Should we spend less time fighting misinformation and more time fighting for information?","type":"media"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Sacha Altay","Hugo Mercier"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1641945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641945600,"objectID":"7f895e66476db81df03d7ad11d3742b5","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2022_hks_misinfo/","publishdate":"2022-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_hks_misinfo/","section":"publication","summary":"A wealth of interventions have been devised to reduce belief in fake news or the tendency to share such news.

As such, a fundamental question for any science of culture is, what ensures this stability in the first place? Here we focus on the evolutionary and stabilising role of ‘convergent transformation’, in which one item causes the production of another item whose form tends to deviate from the original in a directed, non-random way. We present a series of stochastic models of cultural evolution investigating its effects. The results show that cultural stability can emerge and be maintained by virtue of convergent transformation alone, in the absence of any form of copying or selection process. We show how high-fidelity copying and convergent transformation need not be opposing forces, and can jointly contribute to cultural stability. We finally analyse how non-random transformation and high-fidelity copying can have different evolutionary signatures at population level, and hence how their distinct effects can be distinguished in empirical records. Collectively, these results supplement existing approaches to cultural evolution based on the Darwinian analogy, while also providing formal support for other frameworks – such as Cultural Attraction Theory – that entail its further loosening.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","individual based models"],"title":"Culture without copying or selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1637229600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637229600,"objectID":"d379ca55733bd8fc68d727b64837ec0e","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2021_cben/","publishdate":"2021-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021_cben/","section":"talk","summary":"I have been invited at the 2021 meeting of the Cognition, Behavior \u0026 Evolution Network, where I will present some of my research on misinformation and social influence online.","tags":[],"title":"Digital age: the long view.","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1623715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1623715200,"objectID":"fbc6f5c3fdd035f01e99c167c890fe1b","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2021_henrich/","publishdate":"2020-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_henrich/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["cultural evolution"],"title":"Review of Joseph Henrich, The Weirdest People in the World","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622109600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622109600,"objectID":"192b2edb28bd726cc02be9b2279cc4cf","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2021_matchpoints/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021_matchpoints/","section":"talk","summary":"Despite widespread concerns, the supporting evidence of the abundance, effectiveness, and consequences of online misinformation is, at best, mixed.

For this reason, scholars have emphasized social learning when explaining how and why culture evolves. Yet cultural evolution results from many mechanisms operating in concert. Here, we argue that the emphasis on social learning has distracted scholars from appreciating both the full range of mechanisms contributing to cultural evolution and how interactions among those mechanisms and other factors affect the output of cultural evolution. We examine understudied mechanisms and other factors and call for a more inclusive programme of investigation that probes multiple levels of the organization, spanning the neural, cognitive-behavioural and populational levels. To guide our discussion, we focus on factors involved in three core topics of cultural evolution - the emergence of culture, the emergence of cumulative cultural evolution and the design of cultural traits.

Models of cultural evolution have typically assumed that traits are independent of one another and essentially exchangeable. But culture has a structure - traits bear relationships to one another that affect the transmission and selection process itself. Here, we introduce a modelling framework to explore the effect of interdependencies on the process of learning. Through simulations, we find that introducing a simple structure changes the cultural dynamics. Based on a basic filtering mechanism for parsing trait relationships, more elaborate cultural filters emerge. In a mostly incompatible cultural domain of traits, these filters organize culture into mostly (but not fully) consistent and stable systems. Incompatible domains produce small homogeneous cultures, while more compatibility increases size, diversity and group divergence. When individuals copy based on a trait’s features (here, its compatibility relationships), they produce more homogeneous cultures than when they copy based on the agent carrying the cultural trait. We discuss the implications of considering cultural systems and filters in the dynamics of cultural change.","tags":["cultural evolution","transmission biases","individual based models"],"title":"Modelling cultural systems and selective filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivier Morin","Pierre Olivier Jacquet","Krist Vaesen","Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"de466ff77e6fb61c229c4cf56f465f1a","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2021_ptrsb_antisocial/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021_ptrsb_antisocial/","section":"publication","summary":"Social information is immensely valuable. Yet we waste it. The information we get from observing other humans and from communicating with them is a cheap and reliable informational resource. It is considered the backbone of human cultural evolution. Theories and models focused on the evolution of social learning show the great adaptive benefits of evolving cognitive tools to process it. In spite of this, human adults in the experimental literature use social information quite inefficiently - they do not take it sufficiently into account. A comprehensive review of the literature on five experimental tasks documented 45 studies showing social information waste, and four studies showing social information being over-used. These studies cover ‘egocentric discounting’ phenomena as studied by social psychology, but also include experimental social learning studies. Social information waste means that human adults fail to give social information its optimal weight. Both proximal explanations and accounts derived from evolutionary theory leave crucial aspects of the phenomenon unaccounted for - egocentric discounting is a pervasive effect that no single unifying explanation fully captures. Cultural evolutionary theory’s insistence on the power and benefits of social influence is to be balanced against this phenomenon.","tags":["cultural evolution"],"title":"Social information use and social information waste","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618408800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618408800,"objectID":"08665e21bba71c7490324e5d01920887","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2021_roph/","publishdate":"2021-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2021_roph/","section":"talk","summary":"In my talk, I will discuss how cultural evolution can provide a useful framework to understand how information is produced, transmitted, and selected in contemporary online, digital, media.\n\nI will touch topics such as how online media expanded the network where cultural transmission happens; how, contrarily to contemporary worries, we are, on average, wary learners that are not easily influenced; or how the increased fidelity of transmission impacts on cumulative cultural evolution, i.e. the growing complexity of artefacts from one generation to another.\n\nI will discuss more in detail how the (limited) spread of online misinformation can be seen from this perspective, focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive biases.

Does this difference influence which content is successful?\n\n**Methods:** Two fully preregistered online experiments (https://osf.io/wf7pd). The first experiment (N=540) tests whether negative content, threat-related information, and information eliciting disgust are better transmitted than their neutral counterpart in a traditional transmission chain setup. In the second experiment (N=600), the same material is used, but participants are asked whether they would share or not the content in two conditions: in a large anonymous social network, or with their friends, in their favourite social network.\n\n**Results:** Experiment 1 confirmed that attractive content is better transmitted than its neutral counterpart, for all three types of content. Experiment 2 instead showed that, out of six possibilities (2 conditions X 3 contents), in only one the attractive content was shared more than the non-attractive one, i.e. negative content in anonymous sharing.\n\n**Conclusion:** Content biases are stronger when retelling a story than when sharing it.","tags":[],"title":"From storytelling to Facebook.

We analyzed a database of 40 million articles from major scientific publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Nature, Plos, Pubmed, Biomed Central) finding an increase in the number of papers mentioning a species after its inclusion in the list. We also analyzed media penetration (data from Google News), and online interest (data from Google Blogs, Twitter, and Google Trends), collecting daily data for one month before and one after the official launch of the 2014-2016 list (24th November 2015). The results show a short spike of interest on Google News and Twitter but no long term effect, indicating a limited effect on the general public. Our results are important for the understanding of the impact of current conservation campaigns and to provide strategies for future campaigns.","tags":["text mining","conservation","digital media"],"title":"The impact of the “World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates” list on scientific publications and media","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576594800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576594800,"objectID":"4e2b697ae9009a310bba09244edf79e3","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2019_stockholm/","publishdate":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_stockholm/","section":"talk","summary":"In recent years, researchers from many disciplines have included the concept of culture among their explicatory tools.

Understanding the consequences of the massive diffusion of digital media is of the utmost importance, both from the intellectual and the social point of view. 'Cultural Evolution in the Digital Age' proposes that a specific discipline - cultural evolution - provides an excellent framework to analyse our digital age. Cultural evolution is a vibrant, interdisciplinary, and increasingly productive scientific framework that aims to provide a naturalistic and quantitative explanation of culture. In the book the author shows how cultural evolution offers both a sophisticated view of human behaviour, grounded in cognitive science and evolutionary theory, and a strong quantitative and experimental methodology. The book examines in depth various topics that directly originate from the application of cultural evolution research to digital media. Is online social influence radically different from previous forms of social influence? Do digital media amplify the effects of popularity and celebrity influence? What are the psychological forces that favour the spread of online misinformation? What are the effects of the hyper-availability of information online on cultural cumulation? The cultural evolutionary perspective provides novel insights, and a relatively encouraging take on the overall effects of our online activities on our culture. Cultural Evolution is an area of rapidly growing interest, and this timely book will be important reading for students and researchers in the fields of psychology, anthropology, cognitive science, and the media.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","misinformation","digital media","transmission biases"],"title":"Cultural evolution in the digital age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Brand","Alberto Acerbi","Alex Mesoudi"],"categories":null,"content":" Together with Lotty Brand, we wrote a piece for aeon about the paper: Why are pop songs getting sadder than they used to be?\nThe piece was then widely covered by popular and scientific media, including for example The Times (UK), De Standaard (Belgium), or Dagbaldet Information (Danemark)\n","date":1573084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573084800,"objectID":"477085b0b3cb57a7905b5d3bfa1de4c9","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_ehs/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_ehs/","section":"publication","summary":"Popular music offers a rich source of data that provides insights into long-term cultural evolutionary dynamics. One major trend in popular music, as well as other cultural products such as literary fiction, is an increase over time in negatively valenced emotional content, and a decrease in positively valenced emotional content. Here we use two large datasets containing lyrics from n=4,913 and n=159,015 pop songs respectively and spanning 1965-2015, to test whether cultural transmission biases derived from the cultural evolution literature can explain this trend towards emotional negativity. We find some evidence of content bias (negative lyrics do better in the charts), prestige bias (best-selling artists are copied) and success bias (best-selling songs are copied) in the proliferation of negative lyrics. However, the effects of prestige and success bias largely disappear when unbiased transmission is included in the models, which assumes that the occurrence of negative lyrics is predicted by their past frequency. We conclude that the proliferation of negative song lyrics may be explained partly by content bias, and partly by undirected, unbiased cultural transmission.","tags":["cultural evolution","text mining","emotions","transmission biases"],"title":"Cultural evolution of emotional expression in 50 years of song lyrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567987200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567987200,"objectID":"204363624c4d349e73a8c2b9bd81c287","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/lepoint/","publishdate":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/lepoint/","section":"media","summary":"An article on my research on cognitive attraction and misinformation (in french).","tags":null,"title":"Les vraies raisons du succès des infox","type":"media"},{"authors":["Olivier Morin","Alberto Acerbi","Oleg Sobchuk"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1559606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559606400,"objectID":"b22db2bfb5c92d38bf866e33ca8e1c55","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_pal_comm_b/","publishdate":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_pal_comm_b/","section":"publication","summary":"What is fiction about, and what is it good for? An influential family of theories sees fiction as rooted in adaptive simulation mechanisms. In this view, our propensity to create and enjoy narrative fictions was selected and maintained due to the training that we get from mentally simulating situations relevant to our survival and reproduction. We put forward and test a precise version of this claim, the “ordeal simulation hypothesis”. It states that fictional narrative primarily simulates “ordeals”\u0026#58; situations where a person’s reaction might dramatically improve or decrease her fitness, such as deadly aggressions, or decisions on long-term matrimonial commitments. Experience does not prepare us well for these rare, high-stakes occasions, in contrast with situations that are just as fitness-relevant but more frequent (e.g., exposure to pathogens). We study mortality in fictional and non-fictional texts as a partial test for this view. Based on an analysis of 744 extensive summaries of twentieth century American novels of various genres, we show that the odds of dying (in a given year) are vastly exaggerated in fiction compared to reality, but specifically more exaggerated for homicides as compared to suicides, accidents, war-related, or natural deaths. This evidence supports the ordeal simulation hypothesis but is also compatible with other accounts. For a more specific test, we look for indications that this focus on death, and in particular on death caused by an agent, is specific to narrative fiction as distinct from other verbal productions. In a comparison of 10,810 private letters and personal diary entries written by American women, with a set of 811 novels (also written by American women), we measure the occurrence of words related to natural death or agentive death. Private letters and diaries are as likely, or more likely, to use words relating to natural or agentive death. Novels written for an adult audience contain more words relating to natural deaths than do letters (though not diary entries), but this is not true for agentive death. Violent death, in spite of its clear appeal for fiction, does not necessarily provide a clear demarcation point between fictional and non-fictional content.","tags":["cultural evolution","evolutionary psychology","text mining","fiction"],"title":"Why people die in novels: Testing the ordeal simulation hypothesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558537200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558537200,"objectID":"dadb519de14694930a69a9085eeb563e","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/talk/2019_brunel/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_brunel/","section":"talk","summary":"The spread of online misinformation has gained mainstream attention in recent years and it is often touted as one of the biggest threat to a well-functioning society.

The analysis shows that these features are, to a different degree, present in most texts, and thus that general cognitive inclinations may contribute to explain the success of online misinformation. Online misinformation, while being an umbrella term covering many different phenomena, can be characterised, in this perspective, not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency.

One commonly studied learning mechanism is a disproportionate preference for majority opinions, known as conformist transmission. While most theoretical and experimental work approaches the majority in terms of the number of individuals that perform a behaviour or hold a belief, some recent experimental studies approach the majority in terms of the number of instances a behaviour is performed. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that disagreement between these two notions of the majority can arise when behavioural variants are performed at different rates, with different salience or in different contexts (variant overrepresentation) and when a subset of the population act as demonstrators to the whole population (model biases). We also show that because conformist transmission changes the distribution of behaviours in a population, how observers approach the majority can cause populations to diverge, and that this can happen even when the two approaches to the majority agree with regards to which behaviour is in the majority. We discuss these results in light of existing findings, ranging from political extremism on twitter to studies of animal foraging behaviour. We conclude that the factors we considered (variant overrepresentation and model biases) are plausibly widespread. As such, it is important to understand how individuals approach the majority in order to understand the effects of majority influence in cultural evolution.","tags":["cultural evolution","transmission biases","individual based models"],"title":"Copy-the-majority of instances or individuals?

We show that this decrease cannot be explained by changes unrelated to emotionality (such as demographic dynamics concerning age or gender balance, changes in vocabulary richness, or changes in the prevalence of literary genres), and that, in our three corpora, the decrease is driven almost entirely by a decline in the proportion of positive emotion-related words, while the frequency of negative emotion-related words shows little if any decline. Consistently with previous studies, we also find a link between ageing and negative emotionality at the individual level.","tags":["cultural evolution","evolutionary psychology","text mining","fiction","emotions"],"title":"Birth of the cool: a two-centuries decline in emotional expression in Anglophone fiction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"e92a7596dbff42265a257411567fc48c","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2017_phil_sci/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_phil_sci/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution"],"title":"Review of Tim Lewens, Cultural Evolution: Conceptual Challenges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1481760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481760000,"objectID":"8f8829c5c6b300774294850cce09cc18","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_fhn/","publishdate":"2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_fhn/","section":"publication","summary":"Digital media have today an enormous diffusion, and their influence on the behavior of a vast part of the human population can hardly be underestimated. In this review I propose that cultural evolution theory, including both a sophisticated view of human behavior and a methodological attitude to modeling and quantitative analysis, provides a useful framework to study the effects and the developments of media in the digital age. I will first give a general presentation of the cultural evolution framework, and I will then introduce this more specific research program with two illustrative topics. The first topic concerns how cultural transmission biases, that is, simple heuristics such as “copy prestigious individuals” or “copy the majority,” operate in the novel context of digital media. The existence of transmission biases is generally justified with their adaptivity in small-scale societies. How do they operate in an environment where, for example, prestigious individuals possess not-relevant skills, or popularity is explicitly quantified and advertised? The second aspect relates to fidelity of cultural transmission. Digitally-mediated interactions support cheap and immediate high-fidelity transmission, in opposition, for example, to oral traditions. How does this change the content that is more likely to spread? Overall, I suggest the usefulness of a “long view” to our contemporary digital environment, contextualized in cognitive science and cultural evolution theory, and I discuss how this perspective could help us to understand what is genuinely new and what is not.","tags":["cultural evolution","misinformation","digital media","transmission biases"],"title":"A cultural evolution approach to digital media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edwin J.

However, ambiguity within and across disciplines remains as to how to identify conformist transmission empirically. In most studies, a population level outcome has been taken as the benchmark to evidence conformist transmission: a sigmoidal relation between individuals’ probability to copy the majority and the proportional majority size. Using an individual-based model, we show that, under ecologically plausible conditions, this sigmoidal relation can also be detected without equipping individuals with a conformist bias. Situations in which individuals copy randomly from a fixed subset of demonstrators in the population, or in which they have a preference for one of the possible variants, yield similar sigmoidal patterns as a conformist bias would. Our findings warrant a revisiting of studies that base their conformist transmission conclusions solely on the sigmoidal curve. More generally, our results indicate that population level outcomes interpreted as conformist transmission could potentially be explained by other individual-level strategies, and that more empirical support is needed to prove the existence of an individual-level conformist bias in human and other animals.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models","transmission biases"],"title":"Conformity cannot be identified based on population-level signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Claudio Tennie","Alex Mesoudi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"1fb7608125fede9b266cfb76bab07a67","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_rsos/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_rsos/","section":"publication","summary":"The extensive use of social learning is considered a major reason for the ecological success of humans. Theoretical considerations, models and experiments have explored the evolutionary basis of social learning, showing the conditions under which learning from others is more adaptive than individual learning. Here we present an extension of a previous experimental set-up, in which individuals go on simulated ‘hunts’ and their success depends on the features of a ‘virtual arrowhead’ they design. Individuals can modify their arrowhead either by individual trial and error or by copying others. We study how, in a multimodal adaptive landscape, the smoothness of the peaks influences learning. We compare narrow peaks, in which solutions close to optima do not provide useful feedback to individuals, to wide peaks, where smooth landscapes allow an effective hill-climbing individual learning strategy. We show that individual learning is more difficult in narrow-peaked landscapes, but that social learners perform almost equally well in both narrow- and wide-peaked search spaces. There was a weak trend for more copying in the narrow than wide condition, although as in previous experiments social information was generally underutilized. Our results highlight the importance of tasks’ design space when studying the adaptiveness of high-fidelity social learning.","tags":["cultural evolution","experiment"],"title":"Social learning solves the problem of narrow-peaked search landscapes: experimental evidence in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Claudio Tennie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"728e9b41f240beaddf6afcf54e50f9fc","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_jcp/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_jcp/","section":"publication","summary":"Redundant copying has been proposed as a manner to achieve the high-fidelity necessary to pass on and preserve complex traits in human cultural transmission. There are at least 2 ways to define redundant copying. One refers to the possibility of copying repeatedly the same trait over time, and another to the ability to exploit multiple layers of information pointing to the same trait during a single copying event. Using an individual-based model, we explore how redundant copying (defined as in the latter way) helps to achieve successful transmission. The authors show that increasing redundant copying increases the likelihood of accurately transmitting a behavior more than either augmenting the number of copying occasions across time or boosting the general accuracy of social learning. They also investigate how different cost functions, deriving, for example, from the need to invest more energy in cognitive processing, impact the evolution of redundant copying. The authors show that populations converge either to high-fitness/high-costs states (with high redundant copying and complex culturally transmitted behaviors; resembling human culture) or to low-fitness/low-costs states (with low redundant copying and simple transmitted behaviors; resembling social learning forms typical of nonhuman animals). This outcome may help to explain why cumulative culture is rare in the animal kingdom.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"The role of redundant information in cultural transmission and cultural stabilization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1445817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445817600,"objectID":"b19a1f71841e85b80e7f7992d899b04b","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/media/plato/","publishdate":"2015-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/media/plato/","section":"media","summary":"Philosopher Massmio Pigliucci discusses our *If we are all cultural darwinians, what is the fuss about?* on *Plato's Footnotes*.","tags":null,"title":"The Trouble with Cultural Evolution","type":"media"},{"authors":["Francesco Pugliese","Alberto Acerbi","Davide Marocco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441324800,"objectID":"0a11481589e8816129980cce3d47ffda","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2015_plos/","publishdate":"2015-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_plos/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we examine the factors contributing to the emergence of leadership in a group, and we explore the relationship between the role of the leader and the behavioural capabilities of other individuals.

Yet how far the analogy be- tween cultural and genetic evolution should be pushed is open to debate. Here, we examine a recent disagreement that concerns the extent to which cultural trans- mission should be considered a preservative mechanism allowing selection among different variants, or a transformative process in which individuals recreate variants each time they are transmitted. The latter is associated with the notion of \"cultural attraction\". This issue has generated much misunderstanding and confusion. We first clarify the respective positions, noting that there is in fact no substantive incompatibility between cultural attraction and standard cultural evolution ap- proaches, beyond a difference in focus. Whether cultural transmission should be considered a preservative or reconstructive process is ultimately an empirical question, and we examine how both preservative and reconstructive cultural transmission has been studied in recent experimental research in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss how the relative importance of preservative and reconstructive processes may depend on the granularity of analysis and the domain being studied.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction"],"title":"If we are all cultural Darwinians what’s the fuss about?

They are ubiquitous in human societies, and have recently been used as a source of data to test models of cultural dynamics. Although a few statistical regularities have been observed in fashion cycles, their empirical characterization is still incomplete. Here we consider the impact of mass media on popular culture, showing that the release of movies featuring dogs is often associated with an increase in the popularity of featured breeds, for up to 10 years after movie release. We also find that a movie's impact on breed popularity correlates with the estimated number of viewers during the movie's opening weekend—a proxy of the movie's reach among the general public. Movies' influence on breed popularity was strongest in the early 20th century, and has declined since. We reach these conclusions through a new, widely applicable method to measure the cultural impact of events, capable of disentangling the event's effect from ongoing cultural trends.","tags":["cultural evolution"],"title":"Dog Movies Stars and Dog Breed Popularity: A Case Study in Media Influence on Choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","R.

Our simulations show that common observations about the relationship between old and young naturally emerge from repeated cultural learning. In particular, young individuals are more open to learn than older individuals, they are less effective as cultural models, and they possess less cultural traits. We also show that, being more open to learning, young individuals are an important source of cultural change. Cultural change, however, is faster in populations with both young and old. A relatively large share of older individuals, in fact, allows a population to retain more culture, and a large culture can change in more directions than a small culture. For the same reason, considering age-biased cultural transmission in an overlapping generations model, cultural evolution is slower when individuals interact preferentially with models of similar age than when they mainly interact with older models.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"Old and Young Individuals’ Role in Cultural Change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesco Pugliese","Alberto Acerbi","Orazio Miglino","Davide Marocco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1347408000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1347408000,"objectID":"28e8deb5174f1f23134e07324b0e350d","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/cp_2012_leadership/","publishdate":"2012-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cp_2012_leadership/","section":"publication","summary":"For modern biology and ethology, the reason for the emergence of leaders-followers patterns in groups of living organisms, is the need of social coordination.

Recently, however, it has been questioned whether non-human social learning is faithful enough to stabilize those patterns. The observed stability could be interpreted as a result of various constraints that limit the number of possible alternative behaviors, rather than of the fidelity of transmission mechanisms. Those constraints can be roughly described as “internal”, such as mechanical (bodily) properties or cognitive limitations and predispositions, and “external”, such as ecological availability or pressures. Here we present an evolutionary individual-based model that explores the relationships between the evolution of faithful social learning and behavioral constraints, represented both by the size of the behavioral repertoire and by the “shape” of the search space of a given task. We show that the evolution of high-fidelity transmission mechanisms, when associated with costs (e.g. cognitive, biomechanical, energetic, etc.), is only likely if the potential behavioral repertoire of a species is large and if the search space does not provide information that can be exploited by individual learning. Moreover we show how stable behavioral patterns (“traditions”) can be achieved at the population level as an outcome of both high-fidelity and low-fidelity transmission mechanisms, given that the latter are coupled with a small behavioral repertoire or with a search space that provide substantial feedback. Finally, by introducing the possibility of environmental change, we show that intermediate rates of change favor the evolution of faithful social learning.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","individual based models"],"title":"Behavioral constraints and the evolution of faithful social learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Stefano Ghirlanda","Magnus Enquist"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1331078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1331078400,"objectID":"2ff0f3ad402d914396db25ca5629fc8f","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2012_plos/","publishdate":"2012-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_plos/","section":"publication","summary":"Many cultural traits exhibit volatile dynamics, commonly dubbed fashions or fads.

We then simulate the coevolution between many cultural traits and the associated preferences, reproducing power-law frequency distributions of cultural traits (most traits are adopted by few individuals for a short time, and very few by many for a long time), as well as correlations between the rate of increase and the rate of decrease of traits (traits that increase rapidly in popularity are also abandoned quickly and vice versa).

Research on primate social learning typically distinguishes two forms of information that a learner can extract from a demonstrator\u0026#58; copying actions (defined as imitation) or copying only the consequential results (defined as emulation). We propose a decomposition of these learning mechanisms (plus pure individual learning) that incorporates the core idea that social learning can be represented as a search for an optimal behavior that is constrained by different kinds of information. We illustrate our approach with an individual-based model in which individuals solve tasks in abstract “spaces” that represent behavioral actions, results, and benefits of those results. Depending on the learning mechanisms at their disposal, individuals have differential access to the information conveyed in these spaces. We show how different classes of tasks may provide distinct advantages to individuals with different learning mechanisms and discuss how our approach contributes to current empirical and theoretical research on social learning and culture.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"Modeling imitation and emulation in constrained search spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Charles L.

Here, we developed an evolutionary individual-based model to investigate the effect of predation pressure on prey sleep. We investigated three ecological conditions, including one that assumed a dynamic interaction between predator and prey behaviour. In condition 1, we found that monophasic predators (i.e. with one sleep bout per 24 h) select for monophasic prey that sleep perfectly out of phase with predators. In condition 2, predators were monophasic but the safety of prey varied as a function of their activity (sleeping versus awake). In this condition, the prey adjusted their sleeping behaviour to lower the risk of predation. Finally, in condition 3, we modelled a more dynamic interaction between predator and prey, with predator activity dependent on prey activity in the previous hour. In this scenario, the prey adjusted their behaviour relative to one another, resulting in either greater or lesser synchrony in prey as a function of predator searching behaviour. Collectively, our model demonstrates that predator behaviour can have a strong influence on prey sleep patterns, including whether prey are monophasic or polyphasic (i.e. with many sleep bouts per 24 h). The model further suggests that the timing of sleep relative to predator behaviour may depend strongly on how other potential prey partition the activity period.","tags":["sleep","individual based models"],"title":"Predation and the phasing of sleep: an evolutionary individual-based model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Ghirlanda","Alberto Acerbi","Magnus Enquist","Mayuko Makamaru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1270080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1270080000,"objectID":"4314adde5c38ad457e3adaf204f8fbb9","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2010_cur_anthr/","publishdate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010_cur_anthr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"The Sometimes Evitable Route to Conservatism and Persuasiveness.

Our results show that such cultural dynamics tends to produce conservative individuals, i.e., individuals who are reluctant to copy new traits. Openness to new information, however, can be maintained when individuals need significant time to acquire the cultural traits that make them effective cultural models. We show that a gradual enculturation of young individuals by many models and a larger cultural repertoire to be acquired are favorable circumstances for the long-term maintenance of openness in individuals and groups. Our results agree with data about lifetime personality change, showing that openness to new information decreases with age.

Here we address these questions using an evolutionary agent-based model. The model is spatially explicit, with food and sleep sites distributed in two clusters on the landscape. Agents acquire food and sleep energy based on an internal circadian clock coded by 24 traits (one for each hour of the day) that correspond to \"genes\" that evolve by means of a genetic algorithm. These traits can assume three different values that specify the agents' behavior\u0026#58; sleep (or search for a sleep site), eat (or search for a food site), or flexibly decide action based on relative levels of sleep energy and food energy. Individuals with higher fitness scores leave more offspring in the next generation of the simulation, and the model can therefore be used to identify evolutionarily adaptive circadian clock parameters under different ecological conditions. We systematically varied input parameters related to the number of food and sleep sites, the degree to which food and sleep sites overlap, and the rate at which food patches were depleted. Our results reveal that\u0026#58; (1) the increased costs of traveling between more spatially separated food and sleep clusters select for monophasic sleep, (2) more rapid food patch depletion reduces sleep times, and (3) agents spend more time attempting to acquire the \"rarer\" resource, that is, the average time spent sleeping is positively correlated with the number of food patches and negatively correlated with the number of sleep patches. \"Flexible\" genes, in general, do not appear to be advantageous, though their arrangements in the agents' genome show characteristic patterns that suggest that selection acts on their distribution. Collectively, the output suggests that ecological factors can have striking effects on sleep patterns. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a simple model can produce clear and sensible patterns, thus allowing it to be used to investigate a wide range of questions concerning the ecology of sleep. Quantitative data presently are unavailable to test the model predictions directly, but patterns are consistent with comparative evidence from different species, and the model can be used to target ecological factors to investigate in future research.","tags":["sleep","individual based models"],"title":"To sleep or not to sleep: the ecology of sleep in artificial organisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"e9fe2c4cd58723efcaadef75825e998f","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2008_trasmissioni/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2008_trasmissioni/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","in Italian"],"title":"Le trasmissioni della cultura","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1194048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1194048000,"objectID":"4ab571d548b81e34a2fd7a55e33ca8ae","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2007_phd/","publishdate":"2007-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2007_phd/","section":"publication","summary":"My PhD Thesis.","tags":["cultural evolution","ALife/robotics","in Italian"],"title":"La natura della cultura.

Moreover, the obtained results indicate how the iteration of a social and individual learning through out generations lead to a cumulative cultural evolutionary process in which novelties are integrated with previously developed skills and are successfully transmitted in further generations.","tags":["ALife/robotics","cultural evolution"],"title":"Social Learning and Cultural Evolution in Embodied and Situated Agents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Davide Marocco","Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"70c867d1c63cd7db19be23b8edd11ec8","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/cp_2007_adaptation/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cp_2007_adaptation/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present an evolutionary simulation in which a population of 10 mobile robots has to develop a simple behavior consisting in the discrimination of two different foraging areas present in the environment. We show that, given a minimal selective pressure, a combination of individual learning, social facilitation, and selection at the population level can lead to effective results. Consistently with ethological findings, we argue that such dynamics in which simple mechanisms interact at different levels can account for instances of social transmission of behaviors usually interpreted as intentional acts of copying.","tags":["ALife/robotics","cultural evolution"],"title":"Adaptation and Social Facilitation in a Population of Autonomous Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Domenico Parisi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1138665600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1138665600,"objectID":"7585b125c103ec4513195c9e98cc813a","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2006_jasss/","publishdate":"2006-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2006_jasss/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe some simulations that compare cultural transmission between and within generations (inter-generational vs intra-generational transmission) in populations of embodied agents controlled by neural networks. Our results suggest that intra-generational transmission has the role of adding variability to the evolutionary process and that this function seems particularly useful when the population lives in a rapidly changing environment. Adaptation to environmental change is slower if cultural transmission is purely inter-generational while it is faster if a certain amount of intra-generational cultural transmission makes it possible to remove earlier and no longer suitable behaviors, facilitating the emergence of new and more appropriate ones.","tags":["cultural evolution","ALife/robotics"],"title":"Cultural transmission between and within generations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"491f37c170668ee5eb12f94bb7fe8711","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2006_folkbio/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2006_folkbio/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","evolutionary psychology","in Italian"],"title":"Antropologia cognitiva e modularità della mente: il caso della folkbiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Stefano Nolfi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"fbc3e43828b505657fe8d7a53597be6b","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2006_aisc/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2006_aisc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","ALife/robotics","in Italian"],"title":"Trasmissibilità culturale di tratti discreti e continui","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1133568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1133568000,"objectID":"ccb75f5ede70ee297f78520f33a85993","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2005_si/","publishdate":"2005-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2005_si/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","in Italian"],"title":"Antropologia cognitiva: uno stato dell'arte","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"a982df8d14f04d161df9f134d4195445","permalink":"https://acerbialberto.com/publication/ita_2005_folkanthro/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ita_2005_folkanthro/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","in Italian"],"title":"Esiste una folkanthropology?
