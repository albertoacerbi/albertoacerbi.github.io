Among the many interesting pieces of information, not surprisingly, attitudes towards vaccinations are starting to be widely discussed in the press.\nThe first important thing to notice, as the Wellcome Trust correctly does, is that ‘worldwide, 79% of people agree that vaccines are safe and 84% agree that they are effective’ and ‘92% of parents worldwide said that their children have received a vaccine to prevent them from getting childhood diseases .’ Whatever we may think, the majority of people around the world rightly believe that vaccines are good. Of course, there is a minority of people, especially in western countries, that is less convinced of that. Citing again the Wellcome Trust, ‘In France, one in three people disagree that vaccines are safe, the highest percentage for any country worldwide’. The France figure is, however, one of few outliers, also for western countries, where the averages of people disagreeing that vaccines are safe are around 10%.\nStill, that one out of ten persons in western countries could think as such is worrying. Not surprisingly, social media has been identified as one of the culprits of this situation, and I bet that, following the Wellcome Trust survey, the trend will continue (I already found one article here). Out of curiosity, I correlated the Wellcome trust data with recent data on social media penetration/usage in Europe, and they are not correlated.\nWhile I was on it, I also correlated the data with the importance of religion..\n\u0026hellip;the trust in science\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and the GDP pro capita\nNaturally, this is a very basic analysis. It could be for example that, within countries, people that are sceptical of vaccines use more social media than others. That anti-vaxx information spreads effectively in social media is not surprising. There are many reasons why anti-vaccination beliefs are easy to spread (and, conversely, it could be more difficult with pro-vaccination beliefs). Information around vaccines is psychologically attractive, involving potentially disgust and counterintuitive concepts that, coupled with a possible negative bias, make fearmongering on vaccines a good topic for online misinformation. All of this, however, is not a prerogative of digital social media (where correct, pro-vaccine, information also spreads effectively), and vaccine hesitancy is as old as vaccines themselves.\nIn any case, each time you hear someone saying, or writing, that anti-vaccination beliefs are linked to social media you should be sceptical. At least: it is not obvious.\nIf you are interested, all the technical stuff (data, R script, what I coded exactly as “vaccine hesitancy”, “social media penetration”, etc.) are in this GitHub repository.\n","date":1560988800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560988800,"objectID":"ed8066c56cb76143c6339aa8d77a6fbe","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/post/2019_wellcome/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_wellcome/","section":"post","summary":"Data from Wellcome Trust shows no correlation between social media usage and negative opinions towards vaccination","tags":[],"title":"Vaccine hesitancy is not correlated with social media penetration at country-level in Europe","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"You have probably heard the adagio that “man bites dog”, and not “dog bites man”, makes for a good piece of news: unusual, exceptional, events are better stories than everyday occurrences. Hidden behind the surface, however, there is another message that seems so obvious we do not even think about it: both examples are negative events. “Dog wins the lottery” would probably be a good piece of news too, but it is not mentioned. That negative news – and possibly negative narratives in general – are more attractive than positive ones is a bit of a cliché, but it supported by much research.\nAn interesting case-study is false news. By definition, they do not need to describe real facts, so they can exploit our preferences in an almost unconstrained way. In a content analysis of a small sample of articles categorised as online misinformation, I found that negative articles where around five times more numerous than positive articles. It is not just about news. English-language fiction became consistently more negative in the last two centuries, and English-language song lyrics did the same in the last fifty years.\nAnd why, yet, this should be the case? There are many possible explanations: one is that the stories we tell each other are simulations. As much as pilots can exercise their flight skills in dangerous situations safe from risks in a simulator, the pleasure we experience when we enjoy narratives would be rooted in the possibility of exercise our skills in an analogous safe environment. The next time you are in the woods you should be suspicious of the wolf.\nFrom this perspective, it makes sense that negative events are predominant in stories: it is worst to arrive unprepared to a negative event than to a positive one. Some research has explored the idea that, in fact, not generally negative events, but threats are what narratives are about. It does not matter how realistic the threats are: you can enjoy watching The Haunting of Hill House even if you do not think ghosts exist or sharing the dubious news about a morgue employee cremated while taking a nap even if you do not usually hang out in morgues.\nIn a recently published paper, Olivier Morin, Oleg Sobchuk, and I, tried to explore further the threath simulation hypothesis. We found two problems with how the hypothesis is often presented. First, it leaves unspecified which kind of threats should be simulated in narratives. Second, and related, it is not clear whether it is a “theory of fictional content”, i.e. it applies specifically to fictional narratives, or to a more wide range of contents, since, as we saw before, also news tend to bend toward the negative (but also, for example, dreams have been interpreted in the same way).\nIn the paper, we explore a more exacting version of the hypothesis, that we called the Ordeals simulation hypothesis (mainly Olivier’s brainchild). The hypothesis specifies that neither negative events in general, nor threats in general, should be overrepresented in fiction, but ordeals. Ordeals – the meaning is different from the usage of the term in common language – are threats that are severe, rare, and reactable. ‘Reactable’ here means that we cannot prevent them (as we can do for, say, cardiovascular diseases or pathogen contamination), but they are also not completely out of our control (like being struck by lighting). Aggressions, violent social interactions and, most of all, homicides, are all examples of ordeals.\nThe first question is then whether ordeals are overrepresented in fiction with respect to other threats, or, to take a clear case: why do people die in novels? The ordeal simulation hypothesis predicts that agentive or accidental deaths (such as homicides or calamities), but not natural deaths, should be overrepresented. (Game of Thrones is too easy of an example, but I recently read that the currently much talked Chernobyl series may have exaggerated the number of deaths). We coded hundreds of summaries of novels in wikipedia: mortality rates of novels’ characters are disproportionally high, when compared to realistic estimates. For 100,000 adults in US, between 100 and 200 deaths are estimated every year. But, in novels, we calculated this figure as 19,000, that is, three orders of magnitude higher. The realistic rate for agentive death is only 31 over 100,000, but in novels is more than 13,000. Natural deaths are also overrepresented, but less so: in reality the rate is higher than agentive deaths (107\u0026frasl;100,000), while in novels is only around 2,000. (Much more in the paper.)\nThe second question is whether the prominence of agentive deaths is a specific feature of fiction with respect to other kinds of content. To explore this, we used a different methodology: we performed a computer text analysis of two large, comparable, corpora, one of novels and one of private letters and diaries, to detect the frequencies of words related to death in general, and to agentive death (‘kill’, ‘murder’, ‘execution’, etc.) in particular. The ordeal simulation hypothesis would predict that the frequency of agentive death-related words would be higher in the novels than in the private documents, but no difference should be found for general death-related words. In this case, the prediction was not confirmed: mentions of death, both violent and non-violent, were about equally frequent in fictional and non-fictional material.\nWhat can we conclude from all that? Agentive deaths are overrepresented in fiction, but they are also, so it seems, overrepresented in material written without the intention of being made public. Perhaps the ordeal simulation hypothesis is not on the right track. My opinion, however, is that the problem may lie in finding an explanation that works for, and only for, fictional material. From the psychological point of view, how different is to read a true story, a piece of news, or a novel? (agentive deaths sure are overrepresented in news, see the plot below – full study here)\nHow different is to write a novel, a diary entry, or a letter? Perhaps there is no specific feature that makes fictions different from other materials, besides, as suggested before when mentioning misinformation, bigger freedom of explore possible contents. Maybe developing a “theory of fiction” (that works only for fiction) is misguided. There are various elements that make narratives (fiction, diaries, news, but also scientific theories, political orientations, etc.) attractive, these elements are the legitimate objects of study, and we can apply them to various domains, fiction included.\nHere the paper, and if you are really interested, all the data and codes for the analysis.

An influential family of theories sees fiction as rooted in adaptive simulation mechanisms. In this view, our propensity to create and enjoy narrative fictions was selected and maintained due to the training that we get from mentally simulating situations relevant to our survival and reproduction. We put forward and test a precise version of this claim, the “ordeal simulation hypothesis”. It states that fictional narrative primarily simulates “ordeals”\u0026#58; situations where a person’s reaction might dramatically improve or decrease her fitness, such as deadly aggressions, or decisions on long-term matrimonial commitments. Experience does not prepare us well for these rare, high-stakes occasions, in contrast with situations that are just as fitness-relevant but more frequent (e.g., exposure to pathogens). We study mortality in fictional and non-fictional texts as a partial test for this view. Based on an analysis of 744 extensive summaries of twentieth century American novels of various genres, we show that the odds of dying (in a given year) are vastly exaggerated in fiction compared to reality, but specifically more exaggerated for homicides as compared to suicides, accidents, war-related, or natural deaths. This evidence supports the ordeal simulation hypothesis but is also compatible with other accounts. For a more specific test, we look for indications that this focus on death, and in particular on death caused by an agent, is specific to narrative fiction as distinct from other verbal productions. In a comparison of 10,810 private letters and personal diary entries written by American women, with a set of 811 novels (also written by American women), we measure the occurrence of words related to natural death or agentive death. Private letters and diaries are as likely, or more likely, to use words relating to natural or agentive death. Novels written for an adult audience contain more words relating to natural deaths than do letters (though not diary entries), but this is not true for agentive death. Violent death, in spite of its clear appeal for fiction, does not necessarily provide a clear demarcation point between fictional and non-fictional content.","tags":["cultural evolution","evolutionary psychology","text mining","fiction"],"title":"Why people die in novels: Testing the ordeal simulation hypothesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558537200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558537200,"objectID":"dadb519de14694930a69a9085eeb563e","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/talk/2019_brunel/","publishdate":"2019-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019_brunel/","section":"talk","summary":"The spread of online misinformation has gained mainstream attention in recent years and it is often touted as one of the biggest threat to a well-functioning society.

Here I analyse misinformation focusing on the idea that some cultural traits can be successful because their content taps into general cognitive preferences. The research involves 260 articles from media outlets included in two authoritative lists of websites known for publishing hoaxes and ‘fake news’, tracking the presence of negative content, threat-related information, presence of sexually related material, elements associated to disgust, minimally counterintuitive elements (and a particular category of them, i.e., violations of essentialist beliefs), and social information, intended as presence of salient social interactions (e.g., gossip, cheating, formation of alliances), and as news about celebrities. The analysis shows that these features are, to a different degree, present in most texts, and thus that general cognitive inclinations may contribute to explain the success of online misinformation. Online misinformation, while being an umbrella term covering many different phenomena, can be characterised, in this perspective, not as low-quality information that spreads because of the inefficiency of online communication, but as high-quality information that spreads because of its efficiency.

The debate was not particularly interesting by itself (I had many, probably too many, similar conversations starting when I was an undergraduate student) and the readers of this blog know, or suspect, my position, so I am not dwelling on it. There is, however, a marginal aspect that made me think a bit: I have the feeling that, when it is all said and done, the negative attitudes toward quantifications are linked to the idea that quantifying human culture is politically “neoliberal”, if not altogether “right-wing”.\nI am sure that no critic of quantification in anthropology will accept this as their own position and they will express more cogent (at least from their point of view) arguments. It does not matter: I am happy to explore a straw man here. (A tweet that was stating it explicitly appeared at some point over the weekend, and it was “liked” by one of the persons involved in the debate, but that is just a side-note, a “like” on Twitter does not need to mean anything.)\nWhereas I can grasp why some evolutionary approaches can be considered as supporting neoliberal social policies – even though I think the question is more nuanced and complicated – how can quantification by itself be? Is studying how movies influence the popularity of dog breeds neoliberal? Is it counting how many different folktales there are in different populations? Is cultural evolution, intended as a general project of applying scientific and quantitative methods to the study of culture, neoliberal?\nEnough with rhetorical questions, but I would be interested if anybody knows any scholarly reference or developed argument that support this position (again, I know, it is a straw man). The only reason I can think of is that, in the last decades, researchers working on quantitative approaches to culture have been less active in political matters than researchers working on qualitative approaches, even though my impression is that the formers are politically leaning left as much as the rest of social scientists (at least the people that refer to the “cultural evolution” label).\nI am really not interested in starting a debate, but perhaps there are reasons for considering quantification as such, and I’d be happy to exploit collective intelligence to know more (as said, possibly in the form of scholarly publications, etc.).

Culture can be studied as an evolving system, and the comparison between biological and cultural evolution has inspired a productive research agenda in which cultural stability is commonly attributed to the existence of mechanisms of high-fidelity cultural transmission. Other researchers have argued that no such copying processes are necessary to explain cultural stability, and that stability can also emerge as a by-product of convergent transformation (in which an item causes the production of another item whose form tends to deviate from that of the original item in a non random way). To investigate this issue, we present a series of stochastic simulation models of cultural evolution that make no prior assumptions about the type of processes by which cultural units propagate through a population. Results show that cultural stability can emerge and be maintained by convergent transformation alone, even in the absence of any form of copying or selection process. We also show that high-fidelity copying and convergent transformation are, contrary to some previous arguments, not opposing forces, and can in fact jointly contribute to cultural stability. Finally, we analyse how convergent transformation and high-fidelity copying can have different evolutionary signatures at the level of the population, and hence how their differing effects can be distinguished in the empirical record. Our models can be read as formalisations of Cultural Attraction Theory.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","individual based models"],"title":"Cultural stability without copying","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":[],"content":"Online misinformation, fake news, false news, hoaxes, you name it, has been blamed for almost everything bad happening in the last years, from the success of Trump to Brexit, from the election of Bolsonaro to the (relative) spread of the anti-vax movement. The scientific consensus on the prominence and on the effect of online misinformation, however, is, at best, mixed.\nSome highly-publicised studies had supported the scaremongers showing, for example, that falsehood spread farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth or that ‘low-quality’ information is equally likely to go ‘viral’ than ‘hi-quality’ information because of our ‘limited attention’ (notice however that the former study does not compare ‘falsehood’ with ‘truth’, but debunked rumours versus confirmed rumours, so that real news that nobody debunked, i.e. the majority of them, are not even considered, and the latter has been recently retracted).\nMany other works, however, had painted a more nuanced image, showing that the production and the consumption of misinformation is concentrated in a limited portion of social media users, that individuals that have already extreme political views are more likely to be exposed to political misinformation, and that, in general, misinformation is unlikely to change people minds. And, simply, other studies have shown that the actual amount of online misinformation is not that big.\nYet, the narrative supporting that online misinformation is dangerous is itself very persuasive. It is easier to think that the people that voted Trump (you can replace this with whatever you do not like) have been manipulated by evil figures, and if they would have access to the correct information they would have done the right thing. This narrative is also quite dangerous, I think, because creates an easy scapegoat (you can make up any newspaper article with this schema: “How [name of social media] helped [thing that you do not like]”) that often distract to more relevant social, economic, and cultural problems.\nAlso, this narrative does not fit particularly well with an evolutionary account of human behaviour. We are a species that heavily relies on communication, social interactions, and learning from others. While details widely vary, researchers studying cultural evolution and cognition agree that, for the characteristics allowing communication, social interactions, and learning from others to be evolved in the first place, we should not be too gullible. Of course, the conditions could be so different now that we could be more easily tricked, but this is an open question, and, given a ‘presumption of good design’, we should be at least sceptical of answers that are too pessimistic.\nGiven this somewhat reassuring perspective, however, online misinformation does exist, and one can ask what the possible advantages of misinformation could be. In a recent paper, I proposed that one of these could simply be that misinformation can be manufactured building on features that make it attractive in an almost unconstrained way, whereas ‘true’ news cannot, simply because they need to correspond to reality. Misinformation can be designed to spread more than real information does (whether this is a conscious process or not). Cognitive anthropologists have put forward features that make some content, everything else equal, more appealing, memorable, or attention-grabbing than other content.\nHere is an example: many misinformation articles (I examine a small sample of ‘fake news’ from 2017: all the material, including the links and the texts used, is here) contains threat-related information, even though threats do not need to be relevant for us (as in the article that gives the title to this blog post: not many of us usually take naps in a morgue. Still, the false news has been shared/liked/commented more than one million times on Facebook). Other features (negative content, disgust, etc.) and many more details are explained in the paper.\nMisinformation is not low-quality information that succeeds in spreading because of the shortcomings of online communication. Quite the opposite, misinformation, or at least some of it, is high-quality information that spreads because online communication is efficient. The difference is that ‘quality’ is not about truthfulness, but about how it fits with our cognitive predispositions. Online “fake news”, is, from this perspective, not much of a political and propagandistic phenomenon, but is more similar to the diffusion of memes, urban legends, and the like (of course political misinformation exist, even though, interestingly, often takes advantage of similar cognitive preferences to spread, think about the notorious Pizzagate, with its mix of threat, sex, and disgust).\nThe paper is part of a Cultural evolution collection, edited by Jamie Tehrani, and I invite you to have a look at the other articles too!\n","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"f54fc80d5946919a1d67e4d86d306f6b","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/post/2019_morgue/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_morgue/","section":"post","summary":"My new paper on cognitive attraction and online misinformatin","tags":[],"title":"Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"I wrote a presentation of the research behind the paper in this blog post.\nAn article (in Italian) summarising the paper.\n","date":1549929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1549929600,"objectID":"d936b6b0ed684c2e5d240a7d31991ba2","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2019_pal_comm_a/","publishdate":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_pal_comm_a/","section":"publication","summary":"The spread of online misinformation has gained mainstream attention in recent years.

One commonly studied learning mechanism is a disproportionate preference for majority opinions, known as conformist transmission. While most theoretical and experimental work approaches the majority in terms of the number of individuals that perform a behaviour or hold a belief, some recent experimental studies approach the majority in terms of the number of instances a behaviour is performed. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that disagreement between these two notions of the majority can arise when behavioural variants are performed at different rates, with different salience or in different contexts (variant overrepresentation) and when a subset of the population act as demonstrators to the whole population (model biases). We also show that because conformist transmission changes the distribution of behaviours in a population, how observers approach the majority can cause populations to diverge, and that this can happen even when the two approaches to the majority agree with regards to which behaviour is in the majority. We discuss these results in light of existing findings, ranging from political extremism on twitter to studies of animal foraging behaviour. We conclude that the factors we considered (variant overrepresentation and model biases) are plausibly widespread. As such, it is important to understand how individuals approach the majority in order to understand the effects of majority influence in cultural evolution.","tags":["cultural evolution","transmission biases","individual based models"],"title":"Copy-the-majority of instances or individuals?

Just as biologists seek to explain population-level trends in genetic evolution in terms of micro-evolutionary processes such as selection, drift and migration, cultural evolutionists have sought to explain population-level cultural phenomena in terms of underlying social, psychological and demographic factors. Primary amongst these factors are learning biases, describing how cultural items are socially transmitted from person to person. As big datasets become more openly available and workable, and statistical modelling techniques become more powerful, efficient and user-friendly, describing population-level dynamics in terms of simple, individual-level learning biases is becoming more feasible. Here we test for the presence of learning biases in two large datasets of popular song lyrics dating from 1965-2015. We find some evidence of content bias, prestige bias and success bias in the proliferation of negative lyrics, and suggest that negative expression of emotions in music, and perhaps art generally, provides an avenue for people to not only process and express their own negative emotions, but also benefit from the knowledge that prestigious others experience similarly negative emotions as they do.","tags":["cultural evolution","text mining","emotions","transmission biases"],"title":"Cultural evolution of emotional expression in 50 years of song lyrics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Jamshid J.

While, as the readers of this blog know, I am actively involved in the activities to establish a new journal, open-access and self-published, with the Cultural Evolution Society, I am of course in the same situation.

My first reaction was to think to stop reviewing for for-profit publishers that do not compensate reviewers, but the next step would be, in fact, to stop reviewing for for-profit publishers at all. I quickly tweeted about this, and I commented on the excellent post from Pascal Boyer in the International Cognition and Culture Institute’s blog, but, alas, I did not receive much feedback, so here it is again.\nContrary to avoid submitting, avoid reviewing would not be a cost for us (if anything, it would save some time), and, if enough people would do it, it would start to be also inconvenient to submit to those journals, as manuscripts would get stuck for a long(er) time. Also, scholars that would keep reviewing will possibly receive more and more articles, so that they may change their mind.\nNotice I am not saying that peer-review is wrong or useless (I do not think so, and it is anyway irrelevant for my point) or that reviewers must be paid (I do not think so: in a fair system, reviewing should be one of the various activities of researchers, and we are clearly not paid singularly for each of them), but that this may be a way to break the vicious circle that makes scientists complain with one hand and submit with the other.\nThere may be something terribly wrong or naive in it, but this is why blog posts can be useful!\n","date":1531353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531353600,"objectID":"b77c9b742ba5dced630bdf722cb25ceb","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/post/2018_avoiding/","publishdate":"2018-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018_avoiding/","section":"post","summary":"Is there any way out of the vicious circle of for-profit academic publications?","tags":[],"title":"Avoid submitting to for-profit journals seems a lost battle.

All begun for me five years ago (!), and, hopefully, we are getting closer to some tangible result.\nMany things changed from then. Cultural evolution is starting to be a recognised discipline, with its own society. The first successful conference was held last year in Jena, and the next one will be in October in Tempe, Arizona. More and more academic journals are accepting quantitative and evolutionary studies of culture, including the new Nature Human Behaviour, Evolutionary Studies in Imaginative Culture, and an “Evolutionary Human Sciences” journal (I hope this is the correct title) which will soon start for Cambridge University Press.\nMany people feel however that there is still need for a dedicated journal, and within the Cultural Evolution Society we set up a publication committee. In the spirit of full transparency, and as this might be of interest to the members of the society at large, and perhaps to others, here is a short highlight of our plans.\nWe are working to a journal with the goal of providing a space for, for example, opinion/debate pieces, long pieces that would be more difficult to publish elsewhere, datasets, preregistered reports, and so on. In addition, while details are still not settled in stone, we plan to take full advantage of recent innovations and ideas from the open science movement (quoting – more or less literally – Claudio Tennie: “a cultural evolution journal should culturally evolve journals!”): the journal will be self-published, online-only, open access and cost-free for authors, and we intend to experiment with various forms of peer-review (one option I like is a mixed form, where submitted papers, if accepted by the editor for review, are accessbile online for possible “open reviews” and, in the same time, sent to “traditional” invited reviewers).\nThe platform we expect to use is the Open Journal System (one example that influenced our choice is the journal Meta-Psychology) and we hope to be able in the next months to hire a person to set-up the platform. If all goes well there will be some news about it – perhaps before the yearly blog post next June! – and, as usual, comments and feedbacks are welcome.\n","date":1529280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529280000,"objectID":"4580e6c0e95b6203c35d548bf92f2deb","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/post/2018_jce_update/","publishdate":"2018-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018_jce_update/","section":"post","summary":"The Cultural Evolution Society is working on a new journal.","tags":[],"title":"A quick update on the Journal of Cultural Evolution","type":"post"},{"authors":["Damian Ruck","R.

In this review I propose that cultural evolution theory, including both a sophisticated view of human behavior and a methodological attitude to modeling and quantitative analysis, provides a useful framework to study the effects and the developments of media in the digital age. I will first give a general presentation of the cultural evolution framework, and I will then introduce this more specific research program with two illustrative topics. The first topic concerns how cultural transmission biases, that is, simple heuristics such as “copy prestigious individuals” or “copy the majority,” operate in the novel context of digital media. The existence of transmission biases is generally justified with their adaptivity in small-scale societies. How do they operate in an environment where, for example, prestigious individuals possess not-relevant skills, or popularity is explicitly quantified and advertised? The second aspect relates to fidelity of cultural transmission. Digitally-mediated interactions support cheap and immediate high-fidelity transmission, in opposition, for example, to oral traditions. How does this change the content that is more likely to spread? Overall, I suggest the usefulness of a “long view” to our contemporary digital environment, contextualized in cognitive science and cultural evolution theory, and I discuss how this perspective could help us to understand what is genuinely new and what is not.","tags":["cultural evolution","misinformation","digital media","transmission biases"],"title":"A cultural evolution approach to digital media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Edwin J.

However, ambiguity within and across disciplines remains as to how to identify conformist transmission empirically. In most studies, a population level outcome has been taken as the benchmark to evidence conformist transmission: a sigmoidal relation between individuals’ probability to copy the majority and the proportional majority size. Using an individual-based model, we show that, under ecologically plausible conditions, this sigmoidal relation can also be detected without equipping individuals with a conformist bias. Situations in which individuals copy randomly from a fixed subset of demonstrators in the population, or in which they have a preference for one of the possible variants, yield similar sigmoidal patterns as a conformist bias would. Our findings warrant a revisiting of studies that base their conformist transmission conclusions solely on the sigmoidal curve. More generally, our results indicate that population level outcomes interpreted as conformist transmission could potentially be explained by other individual-level strategies, and that more empirical support is needed to prove the existence of an individual-level conformist bias in human and other animals.","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models","transmission biases"],"title":"Conformity cannot be identified based on population-level signatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Claudio Tennie","Alex Mesoudi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1472688000,"objectID":"1fb7608125fede9b266cfb76bab07a67","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2016_rsos/","publishdate":"2016-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_rsos/","section":"publication","summary":"The extensive use of social learning is considered a major reason for the ecological success of humans. Theoretical considerations, models and experiments have explored the evolutionary basis of social learning, showing the conditions under which learning from others is more adaptive than individual learning. Here we present an extension of a previous experimental set-up, in which individuals go on simulated ‘hunts’ and their success depends on the features of a ‘virtual arrowhead’ they design. Individuals can modify their arrowhead either by individual trial and error or by copying others. We study how, in a multimodal adaptive landscape, the smoothness of the peaks influences learning. We compare narrow peaks, in which solutions close to optima do not provide useful feedback to individuals, to wide peaks, where smooth landscapes allow an effective hill-climbing individual learning strategy. We show that individual learning is more difficult in narrow-peaked landscapes, but that social learners perform almost equally well in both narrow- and wide-peaked search spaces. There was a weak trend for more copying in the narrow than wide condition, although as in previous experiments social information was generally underutilized. Our results highlight the importance of tasks’ design space when studying the adaptiveness of high-fidelity social learning.","tags":["cultural evolution","experiment"],"title":"Social learning solves the problem of narrow-peaked search landscapes: experimental evidence in humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Claudio Tennie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"728e9b41f240beaddf6afcf54e50f9fc","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2016_jcp/","publishdate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_jcp/","section":"publication","summary":"Redundant copying has been proposed as a manner to achieve the high-fidelity necessary to pass on and preserve complex traits in human cultural transmission. There are at least 2 ways to define redundant copying. One refers to the possibility of copying repeatedly the same trait over time, and another to the ability to exploit multiple layers of information pointing to the same trait during a single copying event. Using an individual-based model, we explore how redundant copying (defined as in the latter way) helps to achieve successful transmission. The authors show that increasing redundant copying increases the likelihood of accurately transmitting a behavior more than either augmenting the number of copying occasions across time or boosting the general accuracy of social learning. They also investigate how different cost functions, deriving, for example, from the need to invest more energy in cognitive processing, impact the evolution of redundant copying. The authors show that populations converge either to high-fitness/high-costs states (with high redundant copying and complex culturally transmitted behaviors; resembling human culture) or to low-fitness/low-costs states (with low redundant copying and simple transmitted behaviors; resembling social learning forms typical of nonhuman animals).

Yet how far the analogy be- tween cultural and genetic evolution should be pushed is open to debate. Here, we examine a recent disagreement that concerns the extent to which cultural trans- mission should be considered a preservative mechanism allowing selection among different variants, or a transformative process in which individuals recreate variants each time they are transmitted. The latter is associated with the notion of \"cultural attraction\". This issue has generated much misunderstanding and confusion. We first clarify the respective positions, noting that there is in fact no substantive incompatibility between cultural attraction and standard cultural evolution ap- proaches, beyond a difference in focus. Whether cultural transmission should be considered a preservative or reconstructive process is ultimately an empirical question, and we examine how both preservative and reconstructive cultural transmission has been studied in recent experimental research in cultural evolution. Finally, we discuss how the relative importance of preservative and reconstructive processes may depend on the granularity of analysis and the domain being studied.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction"],"title":"If we are all cultural Darwinians what’s the fuss about?

They are ubiquitous in human societies, and have recently been used as a source of data to test models of cultural dynamics.

Here we consider the impact of mass media on popular culture, showing that the release of movies featuring dogs is often associated with an increase in the popularity of featured breeds, for up to 10 years after movie release. We also find that a movie's impact on breed popularity correlates with the estimated number of viewers during the movie's opening weekend—a proxy of the movie's reach among the general public. Movies' influence on breed popularity was strongest in the early 20th century, and has declined since. We reach these conclusions through a new, widely applicable method to measure the cultural impact of events, capable of disentangling the event's effect from ongoing cultural trends.","tags":["cultural evolution"],"title":"Dog Movies Stars and Dog Breed Popularity: A Case Study in Media Influence on Choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","R.

Recently, however, it has been questioned whether non-human social learning is faithful enough to stabilize those patterns. The observed stability could be interpreted as a result of various constraints that limit the number of possible alternative behaviors, rather than of the fidelity of transmission mechanisms. Those constraints can be roughly described as “internal”, such as mechanical (bodily) properties or cognitive limitations and predispositions, and “external”, such as ecological availability or pressures. Here we present an evolutionary individual-based model that explores the relationships between the evolution of faithful social learning and behavioral constraints, represented both by the size of the behavioral repertoire and by the “shape” of the search space of a given task. We show that the evolution of high-fidelity transmission mechanisms, when associated with costs (e.g. cognitive, biomechanical, energetic, etc.), is only likely if the potential behavioral repertoire of a species is large and if the search space does not provide information that can be exploited by individual learning. Moreover we show how stable behavioral patterns (“traditions”) can be achieved at the population level as an outcome of both high-fidelity and low-fidelity transmission mechanisms, given that the latter are coupled with a small behavioral repertoire or with a search space that provide substantial feedback. Finally, by introducing the possibility of environmental change, we show that intermediate rates of change favor the evolution of faithful social learning.","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","individual based models"],"title":"Behavioral constraints and the evolution of faithful social learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Stefano Ghirlanda","Magnus Enquist"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1331078400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1331078400,"objectID":"2ff0f3ad402d914396db25ca5629fc8f","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2012_plos/","publishdate":"2012-03-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012_plos/","section":"publication","summary":"Many cultural traits exhibit volatile dynamics, commonly dubbed fashions or fads.

We illustrate our approach with an individual-based model in which individuals solve tasks in abstract “spaces” that represent behavioral actions, results, and benefits of those results. Depending on the learning mechanisms at their disposal, individuals have differential access to the information conveyed in these spaces.

Here, we developed an evolutionary individual-based model to investigate the effect of predation pressure on prey sleep. We investigated three ecological conditions, including one that assumed a dynamic interaction between predator and prey behaviour. In condition 1, we found that monophasic predators (i.e. with one sleep bout per 24 h) select for monophasic prey that sleep perfectly out of phase with predators. In condition 2, predators were monophasic but the safety of prey varied as a function of their activity (sleeping versus awake). In this condition, the prey adjusted their sleeping behaviour to lower the risk of predation. Finally, in condition 3, we modelled a more dynamic interaction between predator and prey, with predator activity dependent on prey activity in the previous hour. In this scenario, the prey adjusted their behaviour relative to one another, resulting in either greater or lesser synchrony in prey as a function of predator searching behaviour. Collectively, our model demonstrates that predator behaviour can have a strong influence on prey sleep patterns, including whether prey are monophasic or polyphasic (i.e. with many sleep bouts per 24 h). The model further suggests that the timing of sleep relative to predator behaviour may depend strongly on how other potential prey partition the activity period.","tags":["sleep","individual based models"],"title":"Predation and the phasing of sleep: an evolutionary individual-based model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefano Ghirlanda","Alberto Acerbi","Magnus Enquist","Mayuko Makamaru"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1270080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1270080000,"objectID":"4314adde5c38ad457e3adaf204f8fbb9","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2010_cur_anthr/","publishdate":"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2010_cur_anthr/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","individual based models"],"title":"The Sometimes Evitable Route to Conservatism and Persuasiveness.

Our results show that such cultural dynamics tends to produce conservative individuals, i.e., individuals who are reluctant to copy new traits. Openness to new information, however, can be maintained when individuals need significant time to acquire the cultural traits that make them effective cultural models.

We further analyse the dynamic of the evolution of sociality, focusing on the fact that the global adaptiveness is a product of the combination of singularly nonadaptive processes and on the presence of a reinforcing positive feedback within populations, that is, the more \"social\" a population is, the more advantageous it is to exploit social cues in that population.","tags":["ALife/robotics","cultural evolution"],"title":"Orienting learning by exploiting sociality: an evolutionary robotics simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"f37cec7e0d4ab933aa4631577d07903b","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2009_rifl/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2009_rifl/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","cultural attraction","in Italian"],"title":"Modelli evoluzionistici della cultura","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Davide Marocco"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1217635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1217635200,"objectID":"c3d811d3441bdec95067ae95a845bcb0","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2008_si/","publishdate":"2008-08-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2008_si/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["cultural evolution","ALife/robotics","in Italian"],"title":"Trasmissione sociale di comportamenti in una popolazione di robot autonomi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Davide Marocco","Paul Vogt"],"categories":null,"content":"I edited, together with Davide Marocco and Paul Vogt, a double special issue of the journal Connection Science on the topic \u0026ldquo;Social Learning in Embodied Agents\u0026rdquo;.

Here we address these questions using an evolutionary agent-based model. The model is spatially explicit, with food and sleep sites distributed in two clusters on the landscape. Agents acquire food and sleep energy based on an internal circadian clock coded by 24 traits (one for each hour of the day) that correspond to \"genes\" that evolve by means of a genetic algorithm. These traits can assume three different values that specify the agents' behavior\u0026#58; sleep (or search for a sleep site), eat (or search for a food site), or flexibly decide action based on relative levels of sleep energy and food energy. Individuals with higher fitness scores leave more offspring in the next generation of the simulation, and the model can therefore be used to identify evolutionarily adaptive circadian clock parameters under different ecological conditions. We systematically varied input parameters related to the number of food and sleep sites, the degree to which food and sleep sites overlap, and the rate at which food patches were depleted. Our results reveal that\u0026#58; (1) the increased costs of traveling between more spatially separated food and sleep clusters select for monophasic sleep, (2) more rapid food patch depletion reduces sleep times, and (3) agents spend more time attempting to acquire the \"rarer\" resource, that is, the average time spent sleeping is positively correlated with the number of food patches and negatively correlated with the number of sleep patches. \"Flexible\" genes, in general, do not appear to be advantageous, though their arrangements in the agents' genome show characteristic patterns that suggest that selection acts on their distribution. Collectively, the output suggests that ecological factors can have striking effects on sleep patterns. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a simple model can produce clear and sensible patterns, thus allowing it to be used to investigate a wide range of questions concerning the ecology of sleep. Quantitative data presently are unavailable to test the model predictions directly, but patterns are consistent with comparative evidence from different species, and the model can be used to target ecological factors to investigate in future research.","tags":["sleep","individual based models"],"title":"To sleep or not to sleep: the ecology of sleep in artificial organisms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1194048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1194048000,"objectID":"90bd4079c9b6a80d37d4b1cd6b65d62b","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/2007_phd/","publishdate":"2007-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2007_phd/","section":"publication","summary":"My PhD Thesis.","tags":["cultural evolution","ALife/robotics","in Italian"],"title":"La natura della cultura.

Social learning consists of a simple facilitation process that regulates the strength of individual learning on the basis of the number of individuals located nearby. By testing this model in an experimental scenario, in which a population of 10 mobile robots has to develop a simple foraging behavior, we demonstrate how the model proposed produces effective results. By comparing the results obtained in different experimental conditions we also show how the method proposed out-performs other alternative algorithms based on genetic evolution or individual learning. Finally, we briefly discuss how the model proposed can help us to understand the role of social learning in biological organisms.","tags":["ALife/robotics","cultural evolution"],"title":"Social Facilitation on the Development of Foraging Behaviors in a Population of Autonomous Robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Domenico Parisi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1189728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1189728000,"objectID":"5a67b67a91ddc6a0eec6638c2d25f55c","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/cp_2007_pain/","publishdate":"2007-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cp_2007_pain/","section":"publication","summary":"We describe two simple simulations in which artificial organisms evolve an ability to respond to inputs from within their own body and these inputs themselves can evolve. In the first simulation the organisms develop an ability to respond to a pain signal caused by body damage by stopping looking for food when they feel pain since resting while the body is damaged accelerates healing of the body and increases the individual’s survival chances. In the second simulation the pain signal itself evolves, that is, the body develops a tendency to send pain signals to the nervous system when the body is damaged. The results are discussed in terms of an internal robotics in which the robot’s body has an internal structure and not only an external morphology and the neural network that controls the robot’s behavior responds to inputs both from the external environment and from within the body.","tags":["ALife/robotics"],"title":"The evolution of pain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alberto Acerbi","Stefano Nolfi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1175731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1175731200,"objectID":"a7b6df33c585ccc7d7015fb9b648d796","permalink":"https://albertoacerbi.github.io/publication/cp_2007_embodied/","publishdate":"2007-04-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cp_2007_embodied/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we investigate whether social learning or the combination of individual and social learning can provide an adaptive advantage for artificial embodied agents that have to develop behavioural abilities that are too difficult or too costly to be acquired through individual learning.
