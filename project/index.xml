      <title>Cultural evolution and cultural attraction</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/project/4_attraction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in the theoretical debate between cultural attraction theory and “standard” cultural evolution theory.  While I have &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2015_phil_bio/&#34;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that the two approaches are not necessarily in conflict, I believe that cultural attraction theory presents some important points that deserve further empirical investigation. Among them, one is the influence of general cognitive factors on culture, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2017_ehb/&#34;&gt;folktales&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_pal_comm_a/&#34;&gt;online misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. Another is the fact that, in some domains, the actual &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2018_jocc/&#34;&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; of cultural traits might be more important than contextual or “social” factors to determine their success. Much more on all that is explored in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. I recently worked on a series of &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2021_ehs/&#34;&gt;simulation models&lt;/a&gt; that can be considered an attempt to formalise cultural attraction theory. As all this is probably obscure to un-initiated, good places to start here can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/post/2020_cultural_attraction/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/post/2022_continuum/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural evolution in the digital age</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/project/3_ceda/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last years, I became heavily involved in research on digital media. From my perspective, I am interested in how cultural evolution can contribute to the study of cultural dynamics in the digital age, and, at the same time, how new digital media impact on human cultural evolution. &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_fhn/&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an early paper where I present some possible areas of interest and &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_pal_comm_a/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; one where I study online misinformation from a cognitive anthropology perspective. I am also working on how digital media can enhance cumulative cultural evolution, using, so far, the case study of &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/cp_2020_chr/&#34;&gt;online fan fiction&lt;/a&gt;, or on how content biases may act differently for the same story when transmitted orally (similar to the telephone game) with respect to when &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2022_hn_chains/&#34;&gt;shared online&lt;/a&gt;. I did some research on online misinformation and, consistently with an evolutionary approach to social learning, I believe that it is not &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/preprint_misinfo_on_misinfo/&#34;&gt;such a big problem as many believe&lt;/a&gt;, that people that think online misinformation is dangerous tend to also believe that &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/preprint_misinfo_third_person/&#34;&gt;other (not themselves!) people are particularly gullible&lt;/a&gt;, and that we would do better to &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2022_hks_misinfo/&#34;&gt;focus on the broad digital information ecosystem instead that looking specifically to &amp;lsquo;fake news&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; . I wrote a book on the topic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/cultural-evolution-in-the-digital-age-9780198835943&#34;&gt;published by Oxford University Press in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. You won&amp;rsquo;t probably find it in airport bookshops, but it &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_oup/&#34;&gt;was generally well accepted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Individual based models of cultural evolution</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/project/1_ibm/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://acerbialberto.com/project/1_ibm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my academic career as a modeller (in fact, as an artificial life/robotics researcher: &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2006_jasss/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is my first publication ever), and I continue to believe that computational models are a fundamental tool to develop research in cultural evolution. On the one hand, models are excellent theory-generating machines: they allow you to formalise your thought experiments, and to explore their consequences, which is sometimes impossible by intuition alone. On the other, models make your theories explicit and directly testable by other researchers. Recent topics include whether &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2022_hks_misinfo/&#34;&gt;interventions increasing trust on reliable news are more effective than interventions decreasing trust on fake news&lt;/a&gt; (yes, as reliable news is much more abundant than fake news), if &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2021_ehs/&#34;&gt;cultural stability can be obtained without copying or selection&lt;/a&gt; (yes), or whether &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2016_sci_rep/&#34;&gt;conformity can be detected from population-level effects&lt;/a&gt; (not always). I am also particularly interested in the opportunities offered by tools like Git or R Markdown to document step-by-step the development of models, as I did for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/albertoacerbi/oranzees&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I have recently published an open access manual on individual-based models in cultural evolution: &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/IBM-cultevo/&#34;&gt;Individual-based models of cultural evolution. A step-by-step guide using R&lt;/a&gt;. A physical version is available with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.routledge.com/Individual-Based-Models-of-Cultural-Evolution-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-Using/Acerbi-Mesoudi-Smolla/p/book/9781032252063&#34;&gt;Routledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quantitative analysis of large-scale cultural data</title>
      <link>https://acerbialberto.com/project/2_culturomics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am interested in the analysis of large, naturally occurring, datasets to investigate (especially modern) human cultural dynamics. &amp;ldquo;Naturally occurring&amp;rdquo; datasets are datasets that have not been built on purpose (like surveys, census data, etc.) but represent traces (often digital) of human activities. For example, I used data on dog registrations to analyse &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2013_plos_a/&#34;&gt;whether their popularity is due to individual considerations or to social influence&lt;/a&gt; (the latter, it seems), data from Google Books and the Gutenberg project to analyse &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2017_cog_emo/&#34;&gt;the change in the expression of emotions&lt;/a&gt; through the last centuries, data on baby names and last.fm playlists to detect whether the &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2014_ehb/&#34;&gt;turnover in popularity of cultural traits can give us some indication of the learning biases involved&lt;/a&gt;, or data on folktales, to check whether &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2017_ehb/&#34;&gt;their complexity is correlated with the size of the population were they are diffused&lt;/a&gt;. I recently studied the cultural evolution of &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/2019_ehs/&#34;&gt;emotion words in a large (&amp;gt;150,000 songs) data set of English-language song lyrics&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=&#34;https://acerbialberto.com/publication/cp_2020_chr/&#34;&gt;topics and complexity in Harry Potter fan fiction&lt;/a&gt;. This line of work is often close to what is done in digital/computational humanities, or what in sociology is referred to as &amp;lsquo;cultural analytics&amp;rsquo;. What makes my research cohesive is the usage of methods and theories from cultural evolution to test hypotheses on these data. With a slogan: &amp;ldquo;big data need big theory&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
